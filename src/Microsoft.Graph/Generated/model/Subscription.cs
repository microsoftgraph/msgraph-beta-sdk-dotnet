The possible values are: v1_0, v1_1, v1_2, v1_3.

For these subscribers, not setting this property per the timeline would result in subscription operations failing. For subscribers whose notification endpoint already supports TLS 1.2, setting this property is optional. In such cases, Microsoft Graph defaults the property to v1_2.
