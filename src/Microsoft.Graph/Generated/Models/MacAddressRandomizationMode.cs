This can either be persistent or non-persistent randomly generated MAC addresses which are used while connecting to the network. In case of Persistent randomization, android generates a persistent randomized MAC address based on the parameters of the network profile. This MAC address remains the same until factory reset. On the other hand under the non-persistent randomization type, which is used for some networks in Android 12 or higher, the Wi-Fi module re-randomizes the MAC address at the start of every connection or the framework uses the existing randomized MAC address to connect to the network.
