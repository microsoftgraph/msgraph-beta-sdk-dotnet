# mailFolder: delta

Namespace: microsoft.graph

> [!IMPORTANT]
> APIs under the `/beta` version in Microsoft Graph are subject to change. Use of these APIs in production applications is not supported. To determine whether an API is available in v1.0, use the **Version** selector.

Get a set of mail folders that have been added, deleted, or removed from the user's mailbox.

A **delta** function call for mail folders in a mailbox is similar to a GET request, except that by appropriately 
applying [state tokens](/graph/delta-query-overview) in one or more of these calls, 
you can query for incremental changes in the mail folders. This allows you to maintain and synchronize 
a local store of a user's mail folders without having to fetch all the mail folders of that mailbox from the server every time.

## Permissions
One of the following permissions is required to call this API. To learn more, including how to choose permissions, see [Permissions](/graph/permissions-reference).


|Permission type      | Permissions (from least to most privileged)              |
|:--------------------|:---------------------------------------------------------|
|Delegated (work or school account) | Mail.ReadBasic, Mail.Read, Mail.ReadWrite    |
|Delegated (personal Microsoft account) | Mail.ReadBasic, Mail.Read, Mail.ReadWrite    |
|Application | Mail.ReadBasic.All, Mail.Read, Mail.ReadWrite |

## HTTP request
<!-- { "blockType": "ignored" } -->
```http
GET /me/mailFolders/delta
GET /users/{id}/mailFolders/delta
```

## Query parameters

Tracking changes in mail folders incurs a round of one or more **delta** function calls. If you use any query parameter 
(other than `$deltatoken` and `$skiptoken`), you must specify 
it in the initial **delta** request. Microsoft Graph automatically encodes any specified parameters 
into the token portion of the `@odata.nextLink` or `@odata.deltaLink` URL provided in the response. 
You only need to specify any desired query parameters once upfront. 
In subsequent requests, simply copy and apply the `@odata.nextLink` or `@odata.deltaLink` URL from the previous response, as that URL already 
includes the encoded, desired parameters.

| Query parameter	   | Type	|Description|
|:---------------|:--------|:----------|
| $deltatoken | string | A [state token](/graph/delta-query-overview) returned in the `@odata.deltaLink` URL of the previous **delta** function call for the same mail folder collection, indicating the completion of that round of change tracking. Save and apply the entire `@odata.deltaLink` URL including this token in the first request of the next round of change tracking for that collection.|
| $skiptoken | string | A [state token](/graph/delta-query-overview) returned in the `@odata.nextLink` URL of the previous **delta** function call, indicating there are further changes to be tracked in the same mail folder collection. |

### OData query parameters

You can use a `$select` query parameter as in any GET request to specify only the properties your need for best performance. The 
_id_ property is always returned. 

## Request headers
| Name       | Type | Description |
|:---------------|:----------|:----------|
| Authorization  | string  | Bearer {token}. Required. |
| Content-Type  | string  | application/json. Required. |
| Prefer | string  | odata.maxpagesize={x}. Optional. |

## Response

If successful, this method returns a `200 OK` response code and [mailFolder](../resources/mailfolder.md) collection object in the response body.

## Example
##### Request
The following example shows how to make a single **delta** function call, and limit the maximum number of mail folders 
in the response body to 2.

To track changes in the mail folders of a mailbox, you would make one or more **delta** function calls, with 
appropriate state tokens, to get the set of incremental changes since the last delta query. 

You can find a similar example that shows how to use the state tokens to track changes in the messages of a mail folder: 
[Get incremental changes to messages in a folder](/graph/delta-query-messages). The main differences
between tracking mail folders and tracking messages in a folder are in the delta query request URLs, and the query responses 
returning **mailFolder** rather than **message** collections.

 [!IMPORTANT]
 Microsoft Graph SDKs use the v1.0 version of the API by default, and do not support all the types, properties, and APIs available in the beta version. For details about accessing the beta API with the SDK, see [Use the Microsoft Graph SDKs with the beta API](/graph/sdks/use-beta).

 For details about how to [add the SDK](/graph/sdks/sdk-installation) to your project and [create an authProvider](/graph/sdks/choose-authentication-providers) instance, see the [SDK documentation](/graph/sdks/sdks-overview).
