# Update educationOutcome

Namespace: microsoft.graph

> [!IMPORTANT]
> APIs under the `/beta` version in Microsoft Graph are subject to change. Use of these APIs in production applications is not supported. To determine whether an API is available in v1.0, use the **Version** selector.

Update the properties of an [educationOutcome](../resources/educationoutcome.md) object. Only teachers can perform this operation.

## Permissions

One of the following permissions is required to call this API. To learn more, including how to choose permissions, see [Permissions](/graph/permissions-reference).

| Permission type                        | Permissions (from least to most privileged) |
|:---------------------------------------|:--------------------------------------------|
| Delegated (work or school account)     | EduAssignments.ReadWriteBasic, EduAssignments.ReadWrite |
| Delegated (personal Microsoft account) | Not supported. |
| Application                            | EduAssignments.ReadWrite.All, EduAssignments.ReadWriteBasic.All |

## HTTP request

<!-- { "blockType": "ignored" } -->

```http
PATCH /education/classes/{id}/assignments/{id}/submissions/{id}/outcomes/{id}
```

## Request headers

| Name       | Description|
|:-----------|:-----------|
| Authorization | Bearer {token}. Required. |

## Request body

In the request body, supply the values for relevant fields that should be updated. Existing properties that are not included in the request body will maintain their previous values or be recalculated based on changes to other property values. For best performance, don't include existing values that haven't changed.

The **educationOutcome** object will be one of the following derived types: **educationPointsOutcome**, **educationFeedbackOutcome**, or **educationRubricOutcome**. Supply the specific properties relevant to the type of outcome you're updating.

All derived outcome types have a regular and a "published" property appropriate to that type of outcome; for example, **points** and **publishedPoints**, **feedback** and **publishedFeedback**. Do not update the "published" property; it is for internal use. For example, to assign points to an **educationPointsOutcome**, update the **points** property, but do not update **publishedPoints**.

## Response

If successful, this method returns a `200 OK` response code and an updated [educationOutcome](../resources/educationoutcome.md) object in the response body.

If **pointsGradeType** and **points** are updated to a negative or infinite value, the method returns a `400` error message.

```http
HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request
Content-type: application/json

{
	"error": {
		"code": "badRequest",
		"message": "Bad request.",
		"innerError": {
			"code": "invalidGrading",
			"message": "Points must be less than 9999999 when using PointsGradeType."
		}
	}
}
```

If an invalid outcome ID is specified, a `404 Not Found` error is returned.

```http
HTTP/1.1 404 Not Found
Content-type: application/json

{
	"error": {
		"code": "20241",
		"message": "Entity not found. Outcome id: 05d0f76c-1dfa-4442-926c-1b094828b505"
	}
}
```
