# Create oAuth2PermissionGrant (a delegated permission grant)

Namespace: microsoft.graph

> [!IMPORTANT]
> APIs under the `/beta` version in Microsoft Graph are subject to change. Use of these APIs in production applications is not supported. To determine whether an API is available in v1.0, use the **Version** selector.

Create a delegated permission grant, represented by an [oAuth2PermissionGrant](../resources/oauth2permissiongrant.md) object.

A delegated permission grant authorizes a client service principal (representing a client application) to access a resource service principal (representing an API), on behalf of a signed-in user, for the level of access limited by the delegated permissions which were granted.

## Permissions

One of the following permissions is required to call this API. To learn more, including how to choose permissions, see [Permissions](/graph/permissions-reference).

|Permission type      | Permissions (from least to most privileged)              |
|:--------------------|:---------------------------------------------------------|
|Delegated (work or school account) | DelegatedPermissionGrant.ReadWrite.All, Directory.ReadWrite.All    |
|Delegated (personal Microsoft account) | Not supported.    |
|Application | DelegatedPermissionGrant.ReadWrite.All, Directory.ReadWrite.All |

## HTTP request

<!-- { "blockType": "ignored" } -->

```http
POST /oauth2PermissionGrants
```

## Request headers

| Name       | Type | Description |
|:-----------|:------|:----------|
| Authorization  | string  | Bearer {token}. Required. |

## Request body

In the request body, supply a JSON representation of an [oAuth2PermissionGrant](../resources/oauth2permissiongrant.md) object.

The following table shows the properties that are required when you create the [oAuth2PermissionGrant](../resources/oauth2permissiongrant.md).

| Property | Type | Description |
|:---------------|:--------|:----------|
| clientId | String | The **id** of the client [service principal](../resources/serviceprincipal.md) for the application which is authorized to act on behalf of a signed-in user when accessing an API. Required.  |
| consentType | String | Indicates whether authorization is granted for the client application to impersonate all users or only a specific user. *AllPrincipals* indicates authorization to impersonate all users. *Principal* indicates authorization to impersonate a specific user. Consent on behalf of all users can be granted by an administrator. Non-admin users may be authorized to consent on behalf of themselves in some cases, for some delegated permissions. Required.  |
| principalId | String | The **id** of the [user](../resources/user.md) on behalf of whom the client is authorized to access the resource, when **consentType** is *Principal*. If **consentType** is *AllPrincipals* this value is null. Required when **consentType** is *Principal*. |
| resourceId | String | The **id** of the resource [service principal](../resources/serviceprincipal.md) to which access is authorized. This identifies the API which the client is authorized to attempt to call on behalf of a signed-in user. |
| scope | String | A space-separated list of the claim values for delegated permissions which should be included in access tokens for the resource application (the API). For example, `openid User.Read GroupMember.Read.All`. Each claim value should match the **value** field of one of the delegated permissions defined by the API, listed in the **publishedPermissionScopes** property of the resource [service principal](../resources/serviceprincipal.md).  Must not exceed 3850 characters in length.|
| startTime | DateTimeOffset | Currently, the start time value is ignored, but a value is required. Required. |
| expiryTime | DateTimeOffset | Currently, the end time value is ignored, but a value is required. Required. |

## Response

If successful, this method returns a 200-series response code and a new [oAuth2PermissionGrant](../resources/oauth2permissiongrant.md) object in the response body.

 [!IMPORTANT]
 Microsoft Graph SDKs use the v1.0 version of the API by default, and do not support all the types, properties, and APIs available in the beta version. For details about accessing the beta API with the SDK, see [Use the Microsoft Graph SDKs with the beta API](/graph/sdks/use-beta).

 For details about how to [add the SDK](/graph/sdks/sdk-installation) to your project and [create an authProvider](/graph/sdks/choose-authentication-providers) instance, see the [SDK documentation](/graph/sdks/sdks-overview).
