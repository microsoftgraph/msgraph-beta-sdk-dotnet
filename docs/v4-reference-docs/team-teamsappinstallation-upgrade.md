# teamsAppInstallation: upgrade

Namespace: microsoft.graph

> [!IMPORTANT]
> APIs under the `/beta` version in Microsoft Graph are subject to change. Use of these APIs in production applications is not supported. To determine whether an API is available in v1.0, use the **Version** selector.

Upgrade an [app installation](../resources/teamsappinstallation.md) in a [team](../resources/team.md) to the latest version of the app.

> **Note:** Currently, this operation does not support upgrade of apps that require resource-specific consent permissions. For details, see [Known issues](/graph/known-issues#Installation-of-apps-that-require-resource-specific-consent-permissions-is-not-supported).

## Permissions

One of the following permissions is required to call this API. To learn more, including how to choose permissions, see [Permissions](/graph/permissions-reference).

|Permission type      | Permissions (from least to most privileged)              |
|:--------------------|:---------------------------------------------------------|
|Delegated (work or school account) | TeamsAppInstallation.ReadWriteSelfForTeam, TeamsAppInstallation.ReadWriteForTeam, Group.ReadWrite.All**, Directory.ReadWrite.All** |
|Delegated (personal Microsoft account) | Not supported.    |
|Application | TeamsAppInstallation.ReadWriteSelfForTeam.All, TeamsAppInstallation.ReadWriteForTeam.All, Group.ReadWrite.All**, Directory.ReadWrite.All** |

> **Note**: Permissions marked with ** are supported only for backward compatibility. We recommend that you update your solutions to use an alternative permission listed in the previous table and avoid using these permissions going forward.
