# Create organizationalBrandingLocalization
Namespace: microsoft.graph

> [!IMPORTANT]
> APIs under the `/beta` version in Microsoft Graph are subject to change. Use of these APIs in production applications is not supported. To determine whether an API is available in v1.0, use the **Version** selector.

Create a new [organizationalBrandingLocalization](../resources/organizationalBrandingLocalization.md) object. This creates a localized branding and at the same time, the default branding if it doesn't exist.

The default branding is created only once. It's loaded when a localized branding isn't configured for the user's browser language. To retrieve the default branding, see [Get branding](organizationalbranding-get.md).

## Permissions
One of the following permissions is required to call this API. To learn more, including how to choose permissions, see [Permissions](/graph/permissions-reference).

| Permission type                        | Permissions (from least to most privileged) |
|:---------------------------------------|:--------------------------------------------|
| Delegated (work or school account)     | Organization.ReadWrite.All |
| Delegated (personal Microsoft account) | Not supported. |
| Application                            | Organization.ReadWrite.All |

## HTTP request
This request creates a new localization branding and a default branding if one does not already exist. 
<!-- {
  "blockType": "ignored"
}
-->
``` http
POST /organization/{organizationId}/branding/localizations
```

## Request headers
|Name|Description|
|:---|:---|
|Authorization|Bearer {token}. Required.|
|Content-Type|application/json. Required.|

## Request body

The following table shows the properties that are required when you create the [organizationalBrandingLocalization](../resources/organizationalbrandinglocalization.md) object.

| Property     | Type        | Description |
|:-------------|:------------|:------------|
| id | String | An identifier that represents the locale specified using culture names. Culture names follow the RFC 1766 standard in the format "languagecode2-country/regioncode2", where "languagecode2" is a lowercase two-letter code derived from ISO 639-1 and "country/regioncode2" is an uppercase two-letter code derived from ISO 3166. For example, U.S. English is `en-US`. You can't create the default branding by setting the value of **id** to the String types `0` or `default`.  <br/><br/>**NOTE:** Multiple branding for a single locale are currently not supported. |

## Response

If successful, this method returns a `201 Created` response code and an [organizationalBrandingLocalization](../resources/organizationalbrandinglocalization.md) object in the response body.

## Examples

The following example creates a branding localization for French (`fr-FR`) localization. Any unspecified properties of the String type inherit from the value in the default branding object. For example, if the signInPageText in the default branding object is `null`, the signInPageText for the `fr-FR` branding created in this request will also be `null`. To override a `null` value without any text, use a string containing only whitespace.

 [!IMPORTANT]
 Microsoft Graph SDKs use the v1.0 version of the API by default, and do not support all the types, properties, and APIs available in the beta version. For details about accessing the beta API with the SDK, see [Use the Microsoft Graph SDKs with the beta API](/graph/sdks/use-beta).

 For details about how to [add the SDK](/graph/sdks/sdk-installation) to your project and [create an authProvider](/graph/sdks/choose-authentication-providers) instance, see the [SDK documentation](/graph/sdks/sdks-overview).
