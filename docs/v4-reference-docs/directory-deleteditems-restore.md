# Restore deleted item (directory object)

Namespace: microsoft.graph

> [!IMPORTANT]
> APIs under the `/beta` version in Microsoft Graph are subject to change. Use of these APIs in production applications is not supported. To determine whether an API is available in v1.0, use the **Version** selector.

Restore a recently deleted [application](../resources/application.md), [group](../resources/group.md), [servicePrincipal](../resources/serviceprincipal.md), [administrative unit](../resources/administrativeunit.md), or [user](../resources/user.md) object from [deleted items](../resources/directory.md). If an item was accidentally deleted, you can fully restore the item. This is not applicable to security groups, which are deleted permanently.

A recently deleted item will remain available for up to 30 days. After 30 days, the item is permanently deleted.

## Permissions
One of the following permissions is required to call this API. To learn more, including how to choose permissions, see [Permissions](/graph/permissions-reference).

### For applications and service principals:

|Permission type      | Permissions (from least to most privileged)              |
|:--------------------|:---------------------------------------------------------|
|Delegated (work or school account) | Application.ReadWrite.All     |
|Delegated (personal Microsoft account) | Not supported.    |
|Application | Application.ReadWrite.OwnedBy, Application.ReadWrite.All |

The calling app must be assigned one of the following [Azure AD roles](/azure/active-directory/roles/permissions-reference):
+ Global Administrator
+ Application Administrator
+ Cloud Application Administrator
+ Hybrid Identity Administrator

### For users:

|Permission type      | Permissions (from least to most privileged)              |
|:--------------------|:---------------------------------------------------------|
|Delegated (work or school account) | User.ReadWrite.All |
|Delegated (personal Microsoft account) | Not supported. |
|Application | User.ReadWrite.All |

To restore users with privileged administrator roles in delegated scenarios, the app must be assigned with *Directory.AccessAsUser.All* delegated permission, and the calling user must also be assigned a higher privileged administrator role as indicated in [Who can perform sensitive actions](../resources/users.md#who-can-perform-sensitive-actions).

In app-only scenarios, the *User.ReadWrite.All* application permission isn't enough privilege to restore deleted users with privileged administrator roles. The app must be assigned a higher privileged administrator role as indicated in [Who can perform sensitive actions](../resources/users.md#who-can-perform-sensitive-actions).

### For groups:

|Permission type      | Permissions (from least to most privileged)              |
|:--------------------|:---------------------------------------------------------|
|Delegated (work or school account) | Group.ReadWrite.All |
|Delegated (personal Microsoft account) | Not supported.    |
|Application | Group.ReadWrite.All |

### For administrative units:

|Permission type      | Permissions (from least to most privileged)              |
|:--------------------|:---------------------------------------------------------|
|Delegated (work or school account) | AdministrativeUnit.ReadWrite.All |
|Delegated (personal Microsoft account) | Not supported.    |
|Application | AdministrativeUnit.ReadWrite.All |

 [!IMPORTANT]
 Microsoft Graph SDKs use the v1.0 version of the API by default, and do not support all the types, properties, and APIs available in the beta version. For details about accessing the beta API with the SDK, see [Use the Microsoft Graph SDKs with the beta API](/graph/sdks/use-beta).

 For details about how to [add the SDK](/graph/sdks/sdk-installation) to your project and [create an authProvider](/graph/sdks/choose-authentication-providers) instance, see the [SDK documentation](/graph/sdks/sdks-overview).
