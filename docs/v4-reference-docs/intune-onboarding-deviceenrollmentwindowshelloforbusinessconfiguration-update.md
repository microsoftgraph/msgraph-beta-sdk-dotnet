|description|String|The description of the device enrollment configuration Inherited from [deviceEnrollmentConfiguration](../resources/intune-shared-deviceenrollmentconfiguration.md)|
|priority|Int32|Priority is used when a user exists in multiple groups that are assigned enrollment configuration. Users are subject only to the configuration with the lowest priority value. Inherited from [deviceEnrollmentConfiguration](../resources/intune-shared-deviceenrollmentconfiguration.md)|
|createdDateTime|DateTimeOffset|Created date time in UTC of the device enrollment configuration Inherited from [deviceEnrollmentConfiguration](../resources/intune-shared-deviceenrollmentconfiguration.md)|
|lastModifiedDateTime|DateTimeOffset|Last modified date time in UTC of the device enrollment configuration Inherited from [deviceEnrollmentConfiguration](../resources/intune-shared-deviceenrollmentconfiguration.md)|
|version|Int32|The version of the device enrollment configuration Inherited from [deviceEnrollmentConfiguration](../resources/intune-shared-deviceenrollmentconfiguration.md)|
|roleScopeTagIds|String collection|Optional role scope tags for the enrollment restrictions. Inherited from [deviceEnrollmentConfiguration](../resources/intune-shared-deviceenrollmentconfiguration.md)|
|deviceEnrollmentConfigurationType|[deviceEnrollmentConfigurationType](../resources/intune-onboarding-deviceenrollmentconfigurationtype.md)|Support for Enrollment Configuration Type Inherited from [deviceEnrollmentConfiguration](../resources/intune-shared-deviceenrollmentconfiguration.md). Possible values are: `unknown`, `limit`, `platformRestrictions`, `windowsHelloForBusiness`, `defaultLimit`, `defaultPlatformRestrictions`, `defaultWindowsHelloForBusiness`, `defaultWindows10EnrollmentCompletionPageConfiguration`, `windows10EnrollmentCompletionPageConfiguration`, `deviceComanagementAuthorityConfiguration`, `singlePlatformRestriction`, `unknownFutureValue`, `enrollmentNotificationsConfiguration`.|
|pinMinimumLength|Int32|Controls the minimum number of characters required for the Windows Hello for Business PIN.  This value must be between 4 and 127, inclusive, and less than or equal to the value set for the maximum PIN.|
|pinMaximumLength|Int32|Controls the maximum number of characters allowed for the Windows Hello for Business PIN. This value must be between 4 and 127, inclusive. This value must be greater than or equal to the value set for the minimum PIN.|
|pinUppercaseCharactersUsage|[windowsHelloForBusinessPinUsage](../resources/intune-onboarding-windowshelloforbusinesspinusage.md)|Controls the ability to use uppercase letters in the Windows Hello for Business PIN.  Allowed permits the use of uppercase letter(s), whereas Required ensures they are present. If set to Not Allowed, uppercase letters will not be permitted. Possible values are: `allowed`, `required`, `disallowed`.|
|pinLowercaseCharactersUsage|[windowsHelloForBusinessPinUsage](../resources/intune-onboarding-windowshelloforbusinesspinusage.md)|Controls the ability to use lowercase letters in the Windows Hello for Business PIN.  Allowed permits the use of lowercase letter(s), whereas Required ensures they are present. If set to Not Allowed, lowercase letters will not be permitted.

If set to Not Configured, Intune will not override client defaults. Possible values are: `notConfigured`, `enabled`, `disabled`.|
|securityDeviceRequired|Boolean|Controls whether to require a Trusted Platform Module (TPM) for provisioning Windows Hello for Business. A TPM provides an additional security benefit in that data stored on it cannot be used on other devices. If set to False, all devices can provision Windows Hello for Business even if there is not a usable TPM.|
|unlockWithBiometricsEnabled|Boolean|Controls the use of biometric gestures, such as face and fingerprint, as an alternative to the Windows Hello for Business PIN.  If set to False, biometric gestures are not allowed. Users must still configure a PIN as a backup in case of failures.|

If set to disabled, anti-spoofing features are not allowed. If set to Not Configured, the user can choose whether they want to use anti-spoofing.
