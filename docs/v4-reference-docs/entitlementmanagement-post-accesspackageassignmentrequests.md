# Create accessPackageAssignmentRequest

Namespace: microsoft.graph

> [!IMPORTANT]
> APIs under the `/beta` version in Microsoft Graph are subject to change. Use of these APIs in production applications is not supported. To determine whether an API is available in v1.0, use the **Version** selector.

In [Azure AD Entitlement Management](../resources/entitlementmanagement-overview.md), create a new [accessPackageAssignmentRequest](../resources/accesspackageassignmentrequest.md) object.  This operation is used to assign a user to an access package, or to remove an access package assignment.

## Permissions

One of the following permissions is required to call this API. To learn more, including how to choose permissions, see [Permissions](/graph/permissions-reference).

| Permission type                        | Permissions (from least to most privileged) |
|:---------------------------------------|:--------------------------------------------|
| Delegated (work or school account)     | EntitlementManagement.ReadWrite.All |
| Delegated (personal Microsoft account) | Not supported. |
| Application                            | EntitlementManagement.ReadWrite.All |

## HTTP request

<!-- { "blockType": "ignored" } -->

```http
POST /identityGovernance/entitlementManagement/accessPackageAssignmentRequests
```

## Request headers

| Name          | Description   |
|:--------------|:--------------|
| Authorization | Bearer \{token\}. Required. |
| Content-Type  | application/json. Required. |

## Request body

In the request body, supply a JSON representation of [accessPackageAssignmentRequest](../resources/accesspackageassignmentrequest.md) object.

For an administrator to request to create an assignment for a user, the value of the **requestType** property is `AdminAdd`, and the **accessPackageAssignment** property contains the `targetId` of the user being assigned, the **assignmentPolicyId** property identifying the [accessPackageAssignmentPolicy](../resources/accesspackageassignmentpolicy.md), and the **accessPackageId** property identifying the [accessPackage](../resources/accesspackage.md).

For an administrator to request to remove an assignment, the value of the **requestType** property is `AdminRemove`, and the **accessPackageAssignment** property contains the **id** property identifying the [accessPackageAssignment](../resources/accesspackageassignment.md) being removed.

For a non-administrator user to request to create their own assignment for either a first assignment or renew assignment, the value of the **requestType** property is `UserAdd`. The **accessPackageAssignment** property contains the `targetId` with the `id` of the users. The **assignmentPolicyId** property identifies the [accessPackageAssignmentPolicy](../resources/accesspackageassignmentpolicy.md). The **accessPackageId** property identifies the [accessPackage](../resources/accesspackage.md). The user making the request must already exist in the directory.

For a non-administrator user to request to extend their own assignments, the value of the **requestType** property is `UserExtend`. The **accessPackageAssignment** property contains the `targetId` with the `id` of the users. The **assignmentPolicyId** property identifies the [accessPackageAssignmentPolicy](../resources/accesspackageassignmentpolicy.md). The **accessPackageId** property identifies the [accessPackage](../resources/accesspackage.md). The user making the request must already exist in the directory.

## Response

If successful, this method returns a 200-series response code and a new [accessPackageAssignmentRequest](../resources/accesspackageassignmentrequest.md) object in the response body.  

If this is an `AdminAdd` request, then subsequently an [accessPackageAssignment](../resources/accesspackageassignment.md) and, if needed, an [accessPackageSubject](../resources/accesspackagesubject.md) are also created. You can locate those using the query parameters when [listing accessPackageAssignments](entitlementmanagement-list-accesspackageassignments.md).

## Examples
### Example 1: Admin requests a direct assignment for a user already in the directory
#### Request

The following is an example of the request for a direct assignment, in which the administrator is requesting the creation of an assignment for the user. Because the [accessPackageSubject](../resources/accesspackagesubject.md) might not yet exist, the value of the **targetID** is the object ID of the user being assigned, the value of the **accessPackageId** is the desired access package for that user, and the value of **assignmentPolicyId** is a direct assignment policy in that access package.

### Example 4: Remove an assignment

To remove assignments, create a new accessPackageAssignmentRequest object with the following settings:

+ The value of the **requestType** property set to `AdminRemove`.
+ In the accessPackageAssignment property, include an object with the identifier of the accessPackageAssignment objects to delete.

#### Request

#### Request

The following is an example of the request for a direct assignment, in which the administrator is requesting the creation of an assignment for the user, for a user who does not exist in the directory. The value of the **accessPackageId** is the desired access package for that user, and the value of **assignmentPolicyId** is a direct assignment policy in that access package.
