# Delete userFlowLanguagePage

Namespace: microsoft.graph

Deletes the values in an [userFlowLanguagePage](../resources/userflowlanguagepage.md) object. You may only delete the values in an overridesPage, which is used to customize the values shown to a user during a user journey defined by a user flow.

## Permissions

One of the following permissions is required to call this API. To learn more, including how to choose permissions, see [Permissions](/graph/permissions-reference).

|Permission type      | Permissions (from least to most privileged)              |
|:--------------------|:---------------------------------------------------------|
|Delegated (work or school account)|IdentityUserFlow.ReadWrite.All|
|Delegated (personal Microsoft account)| Not supported.|
|Application|IdentityUserFlow.ReadWrite.All|
