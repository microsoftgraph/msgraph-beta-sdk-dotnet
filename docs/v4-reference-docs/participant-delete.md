# Delete participant

> [!IMPORTANT]
> APIs under the `/beta` version in Microsoft Graph are subject to change. Use of these APIs in production applications is not supported. To determine whether an API is available in v1.0, use the **Version** selector.

Namespace: microsoft.graph

Delete a specific participant in a call. In some situations, it is appropriate for an application to remove a participant from an active call. This action can be done before or after the participant answers the call. When an active caller is removed, they are immediately dropped from the call with no pre- or post-removal notification. When an invited participant is removed, any outstanding add participant request is canceled.

## Permissions
One of the following permissions is required to call this API. To learn more, including how to choose permissions, see [Permissions](/graph/permissions-reference).

| Permission type                        | Permissions (from least to most privileged) |
|:---------------------------------------|:--------------------------------------------|
| Delegated (work or school account)     | Not Supported                               |
| Delegated (personal Microsoft account) | Not Supported                               |
| Application                            | Calls.JoinGroupCallsasGuest.All or Calls.JoinGroupCalls.All |

Tenant-level application meeting configuration is required to allow an application to call this API. The tenant admin should call the following cmdlet on the tenant remote PowerShell to grant the permission to the application to call this API. For more information, see [Set-CsApplicationMeetingConfiguration](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/office-docs-powershell/blob/master/skype/skype-ps/skype/Set-CsApplicationMeetingConfiguration.md).
