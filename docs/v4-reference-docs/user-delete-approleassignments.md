# Delete appRoleAssignment

Namespace: microsoft.graph

> [!IMPORTANT]
> APIs under the `/beta` version in Microsoft Graph are subject to change. Use of these APIs in production applications is not supported. To determine whether an API is available in v1.0, use the **Version** selector.

Delete an [appRoleAssignment](../resources/approleassignment.md) that has been granted to a user.

## Permissions

One of the following permissions is required to call this API. To learn more, including how to choose permissions, see [Permissions](/graph/permissions-reference).

|Permission type      | Permissions (from least to most privileged)              |
|:--------------------|:---------------------------------------------------------|
|Delegated (work or school account) | AppRoleAssignment.ReadWrite.All    |
|Delegated (personal Microsoft account) | Not supported.    |
|Application | AppRoleAssignment.ReadWrite.All |

## HTTP request

<!-- { "blockType": "ignored" } -->

```http
DELETE /users/{id}/appRoleAssignments/{id}
```

> [!NOTE]
> As a best practice, we recommend you delete app role assignments using the [Delete appRoleAssignedTo](serviceprincipal-delete-approleassignedto.md) method which deletes through the **appRoleAssignedTo** relationship of the _resource_ service principal, instead of this method.

## Request headers

| Authorization  | Bearer {token}. Required. |

## Request body

Do not supply a request body for this method.

## Response

If successful, this method returns a `204 No Content` response code. It does not return anything in the response body.

 [!IMPORTANT]
 Microsoft Graph SDKs use the v1.0 version of the API by default, and do not support all the types, properties, and APIs available in the beta version. For details about accessing the beta API with the SDK, see [Use the Microsoft Graph SDKs with the beta API](/graph/sdks/use-beta).

 For details about how to [add the SDK](/graph/sdks/sdk-installation) to your project and [create an authProvider](/graph/sdks/choose-authentication-providers) instance, see the [SDK documentation](/graph/sdks/sdks-overview).
