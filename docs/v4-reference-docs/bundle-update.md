# Update bundle

Namespace: microsoft.graph

> [!IMPORTANT]
> APIs under the `/beta` version in Microsoft Graph are subject to change. Use of these APIs in production applications is not supported. To determine whether an API is available in v1.0, use the **Version** selector.

Update the metadata for a [bundle][] of [driveItems][driveItem] by ID.
You can only update the following metadata:

* Bundle name
* Album `coverImageItemId` (if applicable)

Any other change requests will be ignored.

## Permissions

One of the following permissions is required to call this API. To learn more, including how to choose permissions, see [Permissions](/graph/permissions-reference).

|Permission type      | Permissions (from least to most privileged)              |
|:--------------------|:---------------------------------------------------------|
|Delegated (work or school account) | Not supported.                             |

## Request body

In the request body, supply the values for relevant fields that should be
updated. Existing properties that are not included in the request body
will maintain their previous values or be recalculated based on changes to other
property values. For best performance, don't include existing values that haven't changed.

## Response

If successful, this method returns a [driveItem][] resource that represents the updated bundle in the response body.
