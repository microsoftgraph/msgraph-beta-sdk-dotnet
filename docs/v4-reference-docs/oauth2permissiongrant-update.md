# Update oAuth2PermissionGrant (a delegated permission grant)

Namespace: microsoft.graph

> [!IMPORTANT]
> APIs under the `/beta` version in Microsoft Graph are subject to change. Use of these APIs in production applications is not supported. To determine whether an API is available in v1.0, use the **Version** selector.

Update the properties of [oAuth2PermissionGrant](../resources/oauth2permissiongrant.md) object, representing a delegated permission grant.

An **oAuth2PermissionGrant** can be updated to change which delegated permissions are granted, by adding or removing items from the list in **scopes**.

## Permissions

One of the following permissions is required to call this API. To learn more, including how to choose permissions, see [Permissions](/graph/permissions-reference).

|Permission type      | Permissions (from least to most privileged)              |
|:--------------------|:---------------------------------------------------------|
|Delegated (work or school account) | DelegatedPermissionGrant.ReadWrite.All, Directory.ReadWrite.All    |
|Delegated (personal Microsoft account) | Not supported.    |
|Application | DelegatedPermissionGrant.ReadWrite.All, Directory.ReadWrite.All |

## HTTP request
<!-- { "blockType": "ignored" } -->
```http
PATCH /oauth2PermissionGrants/{id}
```

## Request headers

| Name       | Type | Description|
|:-----------|:------|:----------|
| Authorization  | string  | Bearer {token}. Required. |

## Request body

In the request body, supply *only* the values for properties that should be updated. Existing properties that are not included in the request body will maintain their previous values or be recalculated based on changes to other property values.

The following table specifies the properties that can be updated.

| Property	   | Type	|Description|
|:---------------|:--------|:----------|
|scope|String|A space-separated list of the claim values for delegated permissions which should be included in access tokens for the resource application (the API). For example, `openid User.Read GroupMember.Read.All`. Each claim value should match the **value** field of one of the delegated permissions defined by the API, listed in the **publishedPermissionScopes** property of the resource [service principal](../resources/serviceprincipal.md).  Must not exceed 3850 characters in length. <br/><br/> To add new scopes to the existing values, specify both the existing and new scopes in this parameter. Otherwise, the action will overwrite the existing scopes.|

## Response

If successful, this method returns `204 No Content` response code. It does not return anything in the response body.

 [!IMPORTANT]
 Microsoft Graph SDKs use the v1.0 version of the API by default, and do not support all the types, properties, and APIs available in the beta version. For details about accessing the beta API with the SDK, see [Use the Microsoft Graph SDKs with the beta API](/graph/sdks/use-beta).

 For details about how to [add the SDK](/graph/sdks/sdk-installation) to your project and [create an authProvider](/graph/sdks/choose-authentication-providers) instance, see the [SDK documentation](/graph/sdks/sdks-overview).
