## HTTP request

<!-- {
  "blockType": "ignored"
}
-->
``` http
GET /security/attackSimulation/payloads/{payloadId}/detail
```

## Optional query parameters

This method supports the `$count`, `$filter`, `$orderby`, `$skipToken`, `$top`, and `$select` [OData query parameters](/graph/query-parameters) to help customize the response. You can use the `$filter` and `$orderby` query parameters on the **attackTechnique**, **attackType**, **completionDateTime**, **displayName**, **isAutomated**, **launchDateTime**, and **status** properties.

If the result set spans multiple pages, the response body contains an `@odata.nextLink` that you can use to page through the result set.

The following are examples of their use:

<!-- {
  "blockType": "ignored"
}
-->
``` http
GET /security/attackSimulation/payloads/{payloadId}/detail?$count=true
GET /security/attackSimulation/payloads/{payloadId}/detail?$filter={property} eq '{property-value}'
GET /security/attackSimulation/payloads/{payloadId}/detail?$filter={property} eq '{property-value}'&$top=5
GET /security/attackSimulation/payloads/{payloadId}/detail?$orderby={property}
GET /security/attackSimulation/payloads/{payloadId}/detail?$skipToken={skipToken}
GET /security/attackSimulation/payloads/{payloadId}/detail?$top=1
GET /security/attackSimulation/payloads/{payloadId}/detail?$select={property}
