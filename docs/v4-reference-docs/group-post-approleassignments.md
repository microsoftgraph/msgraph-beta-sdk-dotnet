# Grant an appRoleAssignment to a group

Namespace: microsoft.graph

> [!IMPORTANT]
> APIs under the `/beta` version in Microsoft Graph are subject to change. Use of these APIs in production applications is not supported. To determine whether an API is available in v1.0, use the **Version** selector.

Use this API to assign an app role to a security group. All direct members of the group will be considered assigned. Security groups with dynamic memberships are supported. To grant an app role assignment to a group, you need three identifiers:

- **principalId**: The ID of the **group** to which you are assigning the app role.
- **resourceId**: The ID of the resource **servicePrincipal** that has defined the app role.
- **appRoleId**: The ID of the **appRole** (defined on the resource service principal) to assign to the group.

Additional licenses might be required to [use a group to manage access to applications](/azure/active-directory/users-groups-roles/groups-saasapps).

## Permissions

One of the following permissions is required to call this API. To learn more, including how to choose permissions, see [Permissions](/graph/permissions-reference).

|Permission type      | Permissions (from least to most privileged)              |
|:--------------------|:---------------------------------------------------------|
|Delegated (work or school account) | AppRoleAssignment.ReadWrite.All    |
|Delegated (personal Microsoft account) | Not supported.    |
|Application | AppRoleAssignment.ReadWrite.All |

## HTTP request

<!-- { "blockType": "ignored" } -->
```http
POST /groups/{groupId}/appRoleAssignments
```

> [!NOTE]
> As a best practice, we recommend creating app role assignments through the `appRoleAssignedTo` relationship of the _resource_ service principal, instead of the `appRoleAssignments` relationship of the assigned user, group, or service principal.

## Request headers

| Name       | Description|
|:-----------|:----------|
| Authorization | Bearer {token}. Required.  |
| Content-type | application/json. Required. |

## Request body

In the request body, supply a JSON representation of an [appRoleAssignment](../resources/approleassignment.md) object.

The following table shows the properties that are required when you create the [appRoleAssignment](../resources/approleassignment.md). Specify other writable properties as necessary for your **appRoleAssignment**.

| Property | Type | Description |
|--|--|--|
| appRoleId | Guid | The identifier (**id**) for the [app role](../resources/approle.md) which is assigned to the principal. This app role must be exposed in the **appRoles** property on the resource application's service principal (**resourceId**). If the resource application has not declared any app roles, a default app role ID of `00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000` can be specified to signal that the principal is assigned to the resource app without any specific app roles. |
| principalId | Guid | The unique identifier (**id**) for the [group](../resources/group.md) being granted the app role. |
| resourceId | Guid | The unique identifier (**id**) for the resource [service principal](../resources/serviceprincipal.md) for which the assignment is made. |

## Response

If successful, this method returns a `201 Created` response code and an [appRoleAssignment](../resources/approleassignment.md) object in the response body.

## Examples

### Request

Here is an example of the request. In this example, ID in the URL and value of **principalId** would both be the ID of the assigned group.

	AppRoleId = Guid.Parse("00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000")
};

await graphClient.Groups["{group-id}"].AppRoleAssignments
	.Request()
	.AddAsync(appRoleAssignment);

```


 [!IMPORTANT]
 Microsoft Graph SDKs use the v1.0 version of the API by default, and do not support all the types, properties, and APIs available in the beta version. For details about accessing the beta API with the SDK, see [Use the Microsoft Graph SDKs with the beta API](/graph/sdks/use-beta).

 For details about how to [add the SDK](/graph/sdks/sdk-installation) to your project and [create an authProvider](/graph/sdks/choose-authentication-providers) instance, see the [SDK documentation](/graph/sdks/sdks-overview).
