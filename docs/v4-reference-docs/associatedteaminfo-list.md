# List associatedTeamInfo
Namespace: microsoft.graph

> [!IMPORTANT]
> APIs under the `/beta` version in Microsoft Graph are subject to change. Use of these APIs in production applications is not supported. To determine whether an API is available in v1.0, use the **Version** selector.

Get the list of [teams](../resources/associatedteaminfo.md) in Microsoft Teams that a [user](../resources/user.md) is associated with.
Currently, a [user](../resources/user.md) can be associated with a [team](../resources/team.md) in two different ways:
* A [user](../resources/user.md) can be a direct member of a [team](../resources/team.md).
* A [user](../resources/user.md) can be a member of a shared [channel](../resources/channel.md) that is hosted inside a [team](../resources/team.md).

## Permissions
One of the following permissions is required to call this API. To learn more, including how to choose permissions, see [Permissions](/graph/permissions-reference).

|Permission type|Permissions (from least to most privileged)|
|:---|:---|
|Delegated (work or school account) | Team.ReadBasic.All, TeamSettings.Read.All, TeamSettings.ReadWrite.All |
|Delegated (personal Microsoft account) | Not supported.    |
|Application | Team.ReadBasic.All, TeamSettings.Read.All, TeamSettings.ReadWrite.All|

> **Note:** Currently, with user delegated permissions, this operation only works for the `me` user. With application permissions, it works for all users by specifying the specific user ID (`me` alias is not supported with application permissions).

## HTTP request

<!-- {
  "blockType": "ignored"
}

## Request body
Do not supply a request body for this method.

## Response

 [!IMPORTANT]
 Microsoft Graph SDKs use the v1.0 version of the API by default, and do not support all the types, properties, and APIs available in the beta version. For details about accessing the beta API with the SDK, see [Use the Microsoft Graph SDKs with the beta API](/graph/sdks/use-beta).

 For details about how to [add the SDK](/graph/sdks/sdk-installation) to your project and [create an authProvider](/graph/sdks/choose-authentication-providers) instance, see the [SDK documentation](/graph/sdks/sdks-overview).
