In [Azure AD entitlement management](../resources/entitlementmanagement-overview.md), callers can automatically retry a user's request for access to an access package. It is performed on an [accessPackageAssignmentRequest](../resources/accesspackageassignmentrequest.md) object whose **requestState** is in a `DeliveryFailed` or `PartiallyDelivered` state. 

## Permissions

One of the following permissions is required to call this API. To learn more, including how to choose permissions, see [Permissions](/graph/permissions-reference).
