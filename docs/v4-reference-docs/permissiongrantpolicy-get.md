## Response

If successful, this method returns a `200 OK` response code and the requested [permissionGrantPolicy](../resources/permissiongrantpolicy.md) object in the response body.

## Examples

### Request

The following is an example of the request. In this example, the requested policy is the built-in permission grant policy `microsoft-user-default-low`, which includes delegated permissions classified low, for apps from verified publishers or apps registered in this tenant.


# [HTTP](#tab/http)
<!-- {
  "blockType": "request",
  "name": "get_permissiongrantpolicy",
  "sampleKeys": ["microsoft-user-default-low"]
}-->

```msgraph-interactive
GET https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/policies/permissionGrantPolicies/microsoft-user-default-low
```

# [C#](#tab/csharp)

```csharp

GraphServiceClient graphClient = new GraphServiceClient( authProvider );

var permissionGrantPolicy = await graphClient.Policies.PermissionGrantPolicies["{permissionGrantPolicy-id}"]
	.Request()
	.GetAsync();

```


 [!IMPORTANT]
 Microsoft Graph SDKs use the v1.0 version of the API by default, and do not support all the types, properties, and APIs available in the beta version. For details about accessing the beta API with the SDK, see [Use the Microsoft Graph SDKs with the beta API](/graph/sdks/use-beta).

 For details about how to [add the SDK](/graph/sdks/sdk-installation) to your project and [create an authProvider](/graph/sdks/choose-authentication-providers) instance, see the [SDK documentation](/graph/sdks/sdks-overview).

### Response

The following is an example of the response. The policy has two `includes` condition sets, one which matches with delegated permission classified `low` for client apps registered in this tenant, and the other which matches delegated permissions classified `low` for apps from verified publishers (regardless of which tenant the app is registered in).

> **Note:** The response object shown here might be shortened for readability.
