# List deletedItems (directory objects)

Namespace: microsoft.graph

> [!IMPORTANT]
> APIs under the `/beta` version in Microsoft Graph are subject to change. Use of these APIs in production applications is not supported. To determine whether an API is available in v1.0, use the **Version** selector.

Retrieve a list of recently deleted directory objects. Currently, deleted items functionality is only supported for the [application](../resources/application.md), [servicePrincipal](../resources/serviceprincipal.md), [group](../resources/group.md), [administrative unit](../resources/administrativeunit.md), and [user](../resources/user.md) resources.

>**Note:** Deleted security groups are deleted permanently and can't be retrieved through this API.

## Permissions

One of the following permissions is required to call this API. To learn more, including how to choose permissions, see [Permissions](/graph/permissions-reference).

### For applications and service principals:

|Permission type      | Permissions (from least to most privileged)              |
|:--------------------|:---------------------------------------------------------|
|Delegated (work or school account) | Application.Read.All, Application.ReadWrite.All, Directory.Read.All, Directory.ReadWrite.All   |
|Delegated (personal Microsoft account) | Not supported.    |
|Application | Application.Read.All, Application.ReadWrite.All, Directory.Read.All |

### For users:

|Permission type      | Permissions (from least to most privileged)              |
|:--------------------|:---------------------------------------------------------|
|Delegated (work or school account) | User.Read.All, User.ReadWrite.All, Directory.Read.All, Directory.ReadWrite.All |
|Delegated (personal Microsoft account) | Not supported. |
|Application | User.Read.All, User.ReadWrite.All, Directory.Read.All, Directory.ReadWrite.All |

### For groups:

|Permission type      | Permissions (from least to most privileged)              |
|:--------------------|:---------------------------------------------------------|
|Delegated (work or school account) | Group.Read.All, Group.ReadWrite.All, Directory.Read.All |
|Delegated (personal Microsoft account) | Not supported.    |
|Application | Group.Read.All, Group.ReadWrite.All, Directory.Read.All |

### For administrative units:

|Permission type      | Permissions (from least to most privileged)              |
|:--------------------|:---------------------------------------------------------|
|Delegated (work or school account) | AdministrativeUnit.Read.All, AdministrativeUnit.ReadWrite.All |
|Delegated (personal Microsoft account) | Not supported.    |
|Application | AdministrativeUnit.Read.All, AdministrativeUnit.ReadWrite.All |

## HTTP request
<!-- { "blockType": "ignored" } -->
```http 
GET /directory/deleteditems/microsoft.graph.application
GET /directory/deleteditems/microsoft.graph.servicePrincipal
GET /directory/deleteditems/microsoft.graph.group
GET /directory/deletedItems/microsoft.graph.user
GET /directory/deletedItems/microsoft.graph.administrativeUnit
```

The OData cast type is a required part of the URI and calling `GET /directory/deleteditems` without a type is **not** supported.

## Optional query parameters

This method supports the query parameters that are supported by the resource that is specified by the OData cast. That is, `$count`, `$expand`, `$filter`, `$orderBy`, `$search`, `$select`, and `$top` query parameters. Some queries are supported only when you use the **ConsistencyLevel** header set to `eventual` and `$count`. For example:

```msgraph-interactive
https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/directory/deletedItems/microsoft.graph.group?&$count=true&$orderBy=deletedDateTime desc&$select=id,displayName,deletedDateTime
ConsistencyLevel: eventual
```

This example requires the **ConsistencyLevel** header because the `$orderBy` and `$count` query parameters are used in the query.

### Examples using the $orderBy OData query parameter

The `$orderBy` OData query parameter is supported on the **deletedDateTime**, **displayName**, and **userPrincipalName** properties of the deleted object types. On the **deletedDateTime** property, the query requires adding the [advanced query parameters](/graph/aad-advanced-queries) (**ConsistencyLevel** header set to `true` and `$count=true` query string).

| OData cast | Properties supporting $orderBy | Example |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| microsoft.graph.user | deletedDateTime, displayName, userPrincipalName | /directory/deletedItems/microsoft.graph.user?$orderBy=userPrincipalName |
| microsoft.graph.group | deletedDateTime, displayName | /directory/deletedItems/microsoft.graph.group?$orderBy=deletedDateTime asc&$count=true |
| microsoft.graph.application | deletedDateTime, displayName | /directory/deletedItems/microsoft.graph.application?$orderBy=displayName |
| microsoft.graph.device | deletedDateTime, displayName | /directory/deletedItems/microsoft.graph.device?$orderBy=deletedDateTime&$count=true |

## Request headers
| Name      |Description|
|:----------|:----------|
| Authorization  | Bearer &lt;code&gt; *Required*|
| Accept  | application/json |

## Request body
Do not supply a request body for this method.

## Response

If successful, this method returns a `200 OK` response code and collection of [directoryObject](../resources/directoryobject.md) objects in the response body.
## Examples

### Example 1: Retrieve deleted groups

#### Request

# [HTTP](#tab/http)
<!-- {

	.Request()
	.GetAsync();

```


 [!IMPORTANT]
 Microsoft Graph SDKs use the v1.0 version of the API by default, and do not support all the types, properties, and APIs available in the beta version. For details about accessing the beta API with the SDK, see [Use the Microsoft Graph SDKs with the beta API](/graph/sdks/use-beta).

 For details about how to [add the SDK](/graph/sdks/sdk-installation) to your project and [create an authProvider](/graph/sdks/choose-authentication-providers) instance, see the [SDK documentation](/graph/sdks/sdks-overview).

	.Request( queryOptions )
	.Header("ConsistencyLevel","eventual")
	.Select("id,displayName,deletedDateTime")
	.OrderBy("deletedDateTime asc")
