# Create schemaExtension

Namespace: microsoft.graph

> [!IMPORTANT]
> APIs under the `/beta` version in Microsoft Graph are subject to change. Use of these APIs in production applications is not supported. To determine whether an API is available in v1.0, use the **Version** selector.

Create a new [schemaExtension](../resources/schemaextension.md) definition and its associated schema extension property to extend a [supporting resource type](/graph/extensibility-overview#supported-resources).

Schema extensions let you add strongly-typed custom data to a resource. The app that creates a schema extension is the owner app. Depending on the 
[state](/graph/api/resources/schemaextension#schema-extensions-lifecycle) of the extension, the owner app, and only the owner app, may update or delete the extension. 

See examples of how to [define a schema extension that describes a training course](/graph/extensibility-schema-groups#2-register-a-schema-extension-definition-that-describes-a-training-course), 
use the schema extension definition to [create a new group with training course data](/graph/extensibility-schema-groups#3-create-a-new-group-with-extended-data), and 
[add training course data to an existing group](/graph/extensibility-schema-groups#4-add-update-or-remove-custom-data-in-an-existing-group).

## Permissions
One of the following permissions is required to call this API. To learn more, including how to choose permissions, see [Permissions](/graph/permissions-reference).


|Permission type      | Permissions (from least to most privileged)              |
|:--------------------|:---------------------------------------------------------|
|Delegated (work or school account) | Application.ReadWrite.All    |
|Delegated (personal Microsoft account) | Not supported.    |
|Application | Application.ReadWrite.All and Directory.ReadWrite.All |

> [!NOTE]
> Additionally for the delegated flow, the signed-in user must be the owner of the calling application OR the owner of the (application with the) **appId** used to set the **owner** property.

## HTTP request
<!-- { "blockType": "ignored" } -->
```http
POST /schemaExtensions
```

## Request headers
| Name       | Description|
|:---------------|:----------|
| Authorization  | Bearer {token}. Required. |
| Content-Type  | application/json  |

## Request body
In the request body, supply a JSON representation of [schemaExtension](../resources/schemaextension.md) object.

The following table shows the properties that are available when you create a schema extension.

| Parameter | Type | Description|
|:---------------|:--------|:----------|
|description|String|Description for the schema extension.|
|id|String|The unique identifier for the schema extension definition. <br>You can assign a value in one of two ways: <ul><li>Concatenate the name of one of your verified domains with a name for the schema extension to form a unique string in this format, \{_&#65279;domainName_\}\_\{_&#65279;schemaName_\}. As an example, `contoso_mySchema`. NOTE: Only verified domains under the following top-level domains are supported: `.com`,`.net`, `.gov`, `.edu` or `.org`. </li><li>Provide a schema name, and let Microsoft Graph use that schema name to complete the **id** assignment in this format: ext\{_&#65279;8-random-alphanumeric-chars_\}\_\{_&#65279;schema-name_\}. An example would be `extkvbmkofy_mySchema`.</li></ul>This property cannot be changed after creation. |
|owner|String|(Optional) The `appId` of the application that is the owner of the schema extension. This property can be supplied on creation, to set the owner.  If not supplied, then the calling application's `appId` will be set as the owner. So, for example, if creating a new schema extension definition using Graph Explorer, you **must** supply the owner property. Once set, this property is read-only and cannot be changed.|
|properties|[extensionSchemaProperty](../resources/extensionschemaproperty.md) collection|The collection of property names and types that make up the schema extension definition.|
|targetTypes|String collection|Set of Microsoft Graph resource types (that support schema extensions) that this schema extension definition can be applied to.|

## Response

If successful, this method returns `201 Created` response code and [schemaExtension](../resources/schemaextension.md) object in the response body.

## Example

### Example 1: Creating a schema extension using a verified domain

#### Request

The following example shows using a verified domain name, `graphlearn`, and a schema name, `courses`, to form a unique string for the **id** property of the schema extension definition. The unique string is based on this format, \{_&#65279;domainName_\}\_\{_&#65279;schemaName_\}.

In the request body, supply a JSON representation of the [schemaExtension](../resources/schemaextension.md) object.

 [!IMPORTANT]
 Microsoft Graph SDKs use the v1.0 version of the API by default, and do not support all the types, properties, and APIs available in the beta version. For details about accessing the beta API with the SDK, see [Use the Microsoft Graph SDKs with the beta API](/graph/sdks/use-beta).

 For details about how to [add the SDK](/graph/sdks/sdk-installation) to your project and [create an authProvider](/graph/sdks/choose-authentication-providers) instance, see the [SDK documentation](/graph/sdks/sdks-overview).

#### Response

The following is an example of the response.

### Example 3: Creating a schema extension setting the owner

#### Request

The following example shows how to create a schema extension setting the **owner**.  In this scenario, the user of the application might not be the owner of the application (for example if you are using Microsoft Graph Explorer).  In this case you should set the **owner** property to the **appId** of an application you own, otherwise you won't be authorized to create a schema extension. Set the **owner** property in the request, together with the JSON representation of the rest of the properties in the [schemaExtension](../resources/schemaextension.md) object.
