# Update schemaExtension

Namespace: microsoft.graph

> [!IMPORTANT]
> APIs under the `/beta` version in Microsoft Graph are subject to change. Use of these APIs in production applications is not supported. To determine whether an API is available in v1.0, use the **Version** selector.

Update properties in the definition of the specified [schemaExtension](../resources/schemaextension.md). Additive updates to the extension can only be made when the extension is in the `InDevelopment` or `Available` status. This means custom properties or target resource types cannot be removed from the definition, but new custom properties can be added and the description of the extension changed.

The update applies to all the resources that are included in the **targetTypes** property of the extension. These resources are among the [supporting resource types](/graph/extensibility-overview#supported-resources).

For delegated flows, the signed-in user can update a schema extension as long as the **owner** property of the extension is set to the **appId** of an application the signed-in user owns. That application can be the one that initially created the extension, or some other application owned by the signed-in user. 

This criteria for the **owner** property allows a signed-in user to make updates through other applications they don't own, such as Microsoft Graph Explorer. When using Graph Explorer to update a **schemaExtension** resource, include the **owner** property in the PATCH request body. For more information, see the [Extensions](/graph/known-issues#extensions) section in [Known issues with Microsoft Graph](/graph/known-issues).

## Permissions

One of the following permissions is required to call this API. To learn more, including how to choose permissions, see [Permissions](/graph/permissions-reference).


|Permission type      | Permissions (from least to most privileged)              |
|:--------------------|:---------------------------------------------------------|
|Delegated (work or school account) | Application.ReadWrite.All    |
|Delegated (personal Microsoft account) | Not supported.    |
|Application | Application.ReadWrite.All and Directory.ReadWrite.All |

## HTTP request

<!-- { "blockType": "ignored" } -->
```http
PATCH /schemaExtensions/{id}
```

## Optional request headers

| Name      |Description|
|:----------|:----------|
| Authorization  | Bearer {token}. Required. |
| Content-Type   | application/json |

## Request body

In the request body, supply the values for relevant fields that should be updated. Existing properties that are not included in the request body will maintain their previous values or be recalculated based on changes to other property values. For best performance you shouldn't include existing values that haven't changed.

| Property   | Type	|Description|
|:---------------|:--------|:----------|
|description|String|Description for the schema extension.|
|properties|[extensionSchemaProperty](../resources/extensionschemaproperty.md) collection|The collection of property names and types that make up the schema extension definition. Only additive changes are permitted. |
|status|String|The lifecycle state of the schema extension. The initial state upon creation is `InDevelopment`. Possible states transitions are from `InDevelopment` to `Available` and `Available` to `Deprecated`.|
|targetTypes|String collection|Set of Microsoft Graph types (that can support extensions) that the schema extension can be applied to.  Only additive changes are permitted.|

## Response

If successful, this method returns a `204 No Content` response code. Attempting to run this request from an application which you don't own (and without setting the **owner** property to the **appId** of an application you own) returns a `403 Forbidden` response code.

## Example

### Request

The following is an example of the request. You must include the **owner** property if you're running the request from an application which you don't own. In this case, set the **owner** property to the **appId** of an application you own.

 [!IMPORTANT]
 Microsoft Graph SDKs use the v1.0 version of the API by default, and do not support all the types, properties, and APIs available in the beta version. For details about accessing the beta API with the SDK, see [Use the Microsoft Graph SDKs with the beta API](/graph/sdks/use-beta).

 For details about how to [add the SDK](/graph/sdks/sdk-installation) to your project and [create an authProvider](/graph/sdks/choose-authentication-providers) instance, see the [SDK documentation](/graph/sdks/sdks-overview).
