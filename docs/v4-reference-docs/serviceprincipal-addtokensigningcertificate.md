# servicePrincipal: addTokenSigningCertificate

Namespace: microsoft.graph

> [!IMPORTANT]
> APIs under the `/beta` version in Microsoft Graph are subject to change. Use of these APIs in production applications is not supported. To determine whether an API is available in v1.0, use the **Version** selector.

Creates a self-signed signing certificate and returns a [selfSignedCertificate](../resources/selfsignedcertificate.md) object, which is the public part of the generated certificate. The self-signed signing certificate is composed of the following objects which are added to the [servicePrincipal](../resources/serviceprincipal.md): 
+ The [keyCredentials](../resources/keycredential.md) object with the following objects:
    + A private key object with **usage** set to `Sign`.
    + A public key object with **usage** set to `Verify`.
+ The [passwordCredentials](../resources/passwordcredential.md) object.

All the objects have the same value of **customKeyIdentifier**.

The **passwordCredential** is used to open the PFX file (private key). It and the associated private key object have the same value of **keyId**. Once set during creation through the **displayName** property, the subject of the certificate cannot be updated. The **startDateTime** is set to the same time the certificate is created using the action. The **endDateTime** can be up to three years after the certificate is created.

## HTTP request

You can address the service principal using either its **id** or **appId**. **id** and **appId** are referred to as the **Object ID** and **Application (Client) ID**, respectively, in the Azure portal.
<!-- { "blockType": "ignored" } -->

```http
POST /servicePrincipals/{id}/addTokenSigningCertificate
POST /servicePrincipals(appId='{appId}')/addTokenSigningCertificate
```

## Request body

In the request body, provide the following required properties.

| Property	   | Type	|Description|
|:---------------|:--------|:----------|
| displayName | string | Friendly name for the key.  It must start with `CN=`.|
| endDateTime | DateTimeOffset |The date and time when the credential expires. It can be up to 3 years from the date the certificate is created. If not supplied, the default is three years from the time of creation. The timestamp type represents date and time information using ISO 8601 format and is always in UTC time. For example, midnight UTC on Jan 1, 2014 is `2014-01-01T00:00:00Z`.|

## Response

If successful, this method returns a `200 OK` response code and a new [selfSignedCertificate](../resources/selfsignedcertificate.md) object in the response body.

 [!IMPORTANT]
 Microsoft Graph SDKs use the v1.0 version of the API by default, and do not support all the types, properties, and APIs available in the beta version. For details about accessing the beta API with the SDK, see [Use the Microsoft Graph SDKs with the beta API](/graph/sdks/use-beta).

 For details about how to [add the SDK](/graph/sdks/sdk-installation) to your project and [create an authProvider](/graph/sdks/choose-authentication-providers) instance, see the [SDK documentation](/graph/sdks/sdks-overview).
