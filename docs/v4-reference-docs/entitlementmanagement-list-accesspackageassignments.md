# List accessPackageAssignments

Namespace: microsoft.graph

> [!IMPORTANT]
> APIs under the `/beta` version in Microsoft Graph are subject to change. Use of these APIs in production applications is not supported. To determine whether an API is available in v1.0, use the **Version** selector.

In [Azure AD entitlement management](../resources/entitlementmanagement-overview.md), retrieve a list of [accessPackageAssignment](../resources/accesspackageassignment.md) objects. For directory-wide administrators, the resulting list includes all the assignments, current and well as expired, that the caller has access to read, across all catalogs and access packages.  If the caller is on behalf of a delegated user who is assigned only to catalog-specific delegated administrative roles, the request must supply a filter to indicate a specific access package, such as: `$filter=accessPackage/id eq 'a914b616-e04e-476b-aa37-91038f0b165b'`.


## Permissions

One of the following permissions is required to call this API. To learn more, including how to choose permissions, see [Permissions](/graph/permissions-reference).

| Permission type                        | Permissions (from least to most privileged) |
|:---------------------------------------|:--------------------------------------------|
| Delegated (work or school account)     | EntitlementManagement.Read.All, EntitlementManagement.ReadWrite.All |
| Delegated (personal Microsoft account) | Not supported. |
| Application                            | EntitlementManagement.Read.All, EntitlementManagement.ReadWrite.All |

## HTTP request

<!-- { "blockType": "ignored" } -->

```http
GET /identityGovernance/entitlementManagement/accessPackageAssignments
```

## Query parameters

This method supports the `$select`, `$filter`, and `$expand` OData query parameters to help customize the response.

If the user or app is assigned only to catalog-specific administrative roles, the request must supply a filter to indicate a specific access package, such as: `$filter=accessPackage/id eq 'a914b616-e04e-476b-aa37-91038f0b165b'`.

### Example scenarios for using query parameters

- To return the target subject and access package, include `$expand=target,accessPackage`.
- To retrieve only delivered assignments, you can include a query `$filter=assignmentState eq 'Delivered'`.
- To retrieve only assignments for a particular user, you can include a query with assignments targeting the object ID of that user: `$expand=target&$filter=target/objectid+eq+'7deff43e-1f17-44ef-9e5f-d516b0ba11d4'`.
- To retrieve only assignments for a particular user and a particular access package, you can include a query with assignments targeting that access package and the object ID of that user: `$expand=accessPackage,target&$filter=accessPackage/id eq '9bbe5f7d-f1e7-4eb1-a586-38cdf6f8b1ea' and target/objectid eq '7deff43e-1f17-44ef-9e5f-d516b0ba11d4'`.
- To retrieve only assignments resulting from a particular access package assignment policy, you can include a query for that policy: `$filter=accessPackageAssignmentPolicy/id eq 'd92ebb54-9b46-492d-ab7f-01f76767da7f'`.

For general information, see [OData query parameters](/graph/query-parameters).

 [!IMPORTANT]
 Microsoft Graph SDKs use the v1.0 version of the API by default, and do not support all the types, properties, and APIs available in the beta version. For details about accessing the beta API with the SDK, see [Use the Microsoft Graph SDKs with the beta API](/graph/sdks/use-beta).

 For details about how to [add the SDK](/graph/sdks/sdk-installation) to your project and [create an authProvider](/graph/sdks/choose-authentication-providers) instance, see the [SDK documentation](/graph/sdks/sdks-overview).
