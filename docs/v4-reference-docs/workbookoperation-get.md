# Get workbookOperation

Namespace: microsoft.graph

> [!IMPORTANT]
> APIs under the `/beta` version in Microsoft Graph are subject to change. Use of these APIs in production applications is not supported. To determine whether an API is available in v1.0, use the **Version** selector.

Meaningless if this url is called independently. This request is part of all async requests for excel. This is used to retrieve the status of a [workbookOperation](../resources/workbookoperation.md) object.

Currently not all requests support async. Take Create session request as an example.

Issue an async [Create session](./workbook-createsession.md) request, follow the documentation and you may get status code `202 Accepted`, async operation starts from here and you can find the url this document required from the response header, from the **location** part.

## Permissions

One of the following permissions is required to call this API. To learn more, including how to choose permissions, see [Permissions](/graph/permissions-reference).

```

## Request headers

## Examples

### Request

The following is an example of a long-running operation request.

# [HTTP](#tab/http)
<!-- {
  "blockType": "request",
  "name": "get_workbookoperation"
}-->

```msgraph-interactive
GET https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/me/drive/items/{drive-item-id}/workbook/operations/{operation-id}
```

# [C#](#tab/csharp)

```csharp

GraphServiceClient graphClient = new GraphServiceClient( authProvider );

var workbookOperation = await graphClient.Me.Drive.Items["{driveItem-id}"].Workbook.Operations["{workbookOperation-id}"]
	.Request()
	.GetAsync();

```


 [!IMPORTANT]
 Microsoft Graph SDKs use the v1.0 version of the API by default, and do not support all the types, properties, and APIs available in the beta version. For details about accessing the beta API with the SDK, see [Use the Microsoft Graph SDKs with the beta API](/graph/sdks/use-beta).

 For details about how to [add the SDK](/graph/sdks/sdk-installation) to your project and [create an authProvider](/graph/sdks/choose-authentication-providers) instance, see the [SDK documentation](/graph/sdks/sdks-overview).
