# List places

Namespace: microsoft.graph

> [!IMPORTANT]
> APIs under the `/beta` version in Microsoft Graph are subject to change. Use of these APIs in production applications is not supported. To determine whether an API is available in v1.0, use the **Version** selector.

Get a collection of the specified type of [place](../resources/place.md) objects defined in the tenant. 

You can do the following for a given tenant:
- [List all the rooms](#example-1-list-all-the-rooms-defined-in-the-tenant).
- [List all the workspaces](#example-2-list-all-the-workspaces-defined-in-the-tenant).
- [List all the room lists](#example-3-list-all-the-room-lists-defined-in-the-tenant).
- [List rooms in a specific room list](#example-4-list-rooms-contained-in-a-room-list).
- [List workspaces in a specific room list](#example-5-list-workspaces-contained-in-a-room-list).

A **place** object can be one of the following types:

* A [room](../resources/room.md), which includes rich properties such as an email address for the room, and accessibility, capacity, and device support. 
* A [workspace](../resources/workspace.md), which includes properties such as an email address for the workspace, and accessibility and capacity. 
* A [roomList](../resources/roomlist.md), which includes an email address for the room list, and a navigation property to get the collection of room instances in the room list. 

The **room**, **workspace** and **roomList** resources are derived from the **place** object.

By default, this operation returns up to 100 places per page. 

Compared with the [findRooms](../api/user-findrooms.md) and [findRoomLists](../api/user-findroomlists.md) functions, this operation returns a richer payload for rooms and room lists. For details about how they compare, see [Using the places API](../resources/place.md#using-the-places-api).

## Permissions

One of the following permissions is required to call this API. To learn more, including how to choose permissions, see [Permissions](/graph/permissions-reference).

| Permission type                        | Permissions (from least to most privileged) |

| Delegated (work or school account)     | Place.Read.All |
| Delegated (personal Microsoft account) | Not supported |
| Application                            | Place.Read.All |
