# List transitiveRoleAssignment

Namespace: microsoft.graph

> [!IMPORTANT]
> APIs under the `/beta` version in Microsoft Graph are subject to change. Use of these APIs in production applications is not supported. To determine whether an API is available in v1.0, use the **Version** selector.

Get the list of direct and transitive [unifiedRoleAssignment](../resources/unifiedroleassignment.md) objects for a specific principal. For example, if a user is assigned an Azure AD role through group membership, the role assignment is transitive, and this request will list the group's ID as the **principalId**. Results can also be filtered by the **roleDefinitionId** and **directoryScopeId**. Supported only for directory (Azure AD) provider.

For more information, see [Use Azure AD groups to manage role assignments](/azure/active-directory/roles/groups-concept).

> [!NOTE]
> This request might have replication delays for role assignments that were recently created, updated, or deleted.

## Permissions

One of the following permissions is required to call this API. To learn more, including how to choose permissions, see [Permissions](/graph/permissions-reference).

|Permission type      | Permissions (from least to most privileged)              |
|:--------------------|:---------------------------------------------------------|
|Delegated (work or school account) | RoleManagement.Read.Directory, Directory.Read.All, RoleManagement.ReadWrite.Directory, Directory.ReadWrite.All |
|Delegated (personal Microsoft account) | Not supported.    |
|Application | RoleManagement.Read.Directory, Directory.Read.All, RoleManagement.ReadWrite.Directory, Directory.ReadWrite.All |

## HTTP request

To list transitive role assignments for a directory provider:

<!-- {
  "blockType": "ignored"
}
-->
```http
GET /roleManagement/directory/transitiveRoleAssignments?$filter=principalId eq '{principalId}'
```

## Optional query parameters

This method supports the `$count`, `$filter` (`eq`), and `$select` OData query parameters to help customize the response. For general information, see [OData query parameters](/graph/query-parameters). You can filter by the **principalId**, **roleDefinitionId** and **directoryScopeId** to retrieve both direct and transitive role assignments for a principal.

## Request headers

| Name      |Description|
|:----------|:----------|
| Authorization | Bearer {token} Required. |
| ConsistencyLevel | eventual. This header, `$count`, and `$filter` are required. For more information about the use of **ConsistencyLevel**, `$count`, and `$filter`, see [Advanced query capabilities on Azure AD directory objects](/graph/aad-advanced-queries). |

## Request body

Do not supply a request body for this method.

## Response

If successful, this method returns a `200 OK` response code and a collection of [unifiedRoleAssignment](../resources/unifiedroleassignment.md) objects in the response body.

If your request doesn't include the **ConsistencyLevel** header set to `eventual`, this method returns `404 Not Found` response code.

## Examples
For the examples in this section, consider the following role assignment scenario. A user named Alice has both direct and transitive role assignments as follows:

| User | Group | Role | Scope | Role assignment ID |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Alice<br/>`2c7936bc-3517-40f3-8eda-4806637b6516` |  | User Administrator<br/>`fe930be7-5e62-47db-91af-98c3a49a38b1` | Tenant | RA1<br/>`857708a7-b5e0-44f9-bfd7-53531d72a739` |
|  | G1<br/>`ae2fc327-4c71-48ed-b6ca-f48632186510`<br/>(Alice is a member) | User Administrator<br/>`fe930be7-5e62-47db-91af-98c3a49a38b1` | Tenant | RA2<br/>`8a021d5f-7351-4713-aab4-b088504d476e` |
|  | G2<br/>`6ffb34b8-5e6d-4727-a7f9-93245e7f6ea8`<br/>(Alice is a member) | Helpdesk Administrator<br/>`729827e3-9c14-49f7-bb1b-9608f156bbb8` | Administrative unit (AU1)<br/>`26e79164-0c5c-4281-8c5b-be7bc7809fb2` | RA3<br/>`6cc86637-13c8-473f-afdc-e0e65c9734d2` |

+ Alice is assigned the User Administrator role directly at tenant scope with role assignment RA1. 
+ Alice is member of a group G1 and G1 is assigned the User Administrator role at tenant scope with role assignment RA2.
+ Alice is also a member of group G2 and G2 is assigned the Helpdesk Administrator role at an administrative unit AU1 scope with role assignment RA3.

### Example 1 : Get direct and transitive role assignments of a principal
