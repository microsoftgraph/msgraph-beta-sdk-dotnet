# listItem: createLink

Namespace: microsoft.graph

> [!IMPORTANT]
> APIs under the `/beta` version in Microsoft Graph are subject to change. Use of these APIs in production applications is not supported. To determine whether an API is available in v1.0, use the **Version** selector.

Create a sharing link for a [listItem](../resources/listitem.md).

The **createLink** action creates a new sharing link if the specified link type doesn't already exist for the calling application.
If a sharing link of the specified type already exists for the app, this action will return the existing sharing link.

**listItem** resources inherit sharing permissions from the [list](../resources/list.md) the item resides in.

## Permissions
One of the following permissions is required to call this API. To learn more, including how to choose permissions, see [permissions](/graph/permissions-reference).

|Permission type|Permissions (from least to most privileged)|
|:---|:---|
|Delegated (work or school account) | Files.ReadWrite, Files.ReadWrite.All, Sites.ReadWrite.All    |
|Delegated (personal Microsoft account) | Files.ReadWrite, Files.ReadWrite.All    |
|Application | Files.ReadWrite.All, Sites.ReadWrite.All |

## Response

If successful, this method returns a single [permission](../resources/permission.md) resource in the response body that represents the requested sharing permissions.

The response will be `201 Created` if a new sharing link is created for the listItem or `200 OK` if an existing link is returned.

## Examples

### Example 1: Create an anonymous sharing link
The following example requests a sharing link to be created for the listItem specified by {itemId} in the list specified {listId}.
The sharing link is configured to be read-only and usable by anyone with the link.

#### Request

### Example 2: Creating company sharable links

OneDrive for Business and SharePoint support company sharable links.
These are similar to anonymous links, except they only work for members of the owning organization.
To create a company sharable link, use the **scope** parameter with a value of `organization`.

#### Request


# [HTTP](#tab/http)
<!-- {
  "blockType": "request",
  "name": "listItem_createlink_create_company_shareable_links"
}-->

```http
POST /sites/{siteId}/lists/{listId}/items/{itemId}/createLink
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "type": "edit",
  "scope": "organization"
}
```

# [C#](#tab/csharp)

```csharp

GraphServiceClient graphClient = new GraphServiceClient( authProvider );

var type = "edit";

var scope = "organization";

await graphClient.Sites["{site-id}"].Lists["{list-id}"].Items["{listItem-id}"]
	.CreateLink(type,scope,null,null,null,null)
	.Request()
	.PostAsync();

```


 [!IMPORTANT]
 Microsoft Graph SDKs use the v1.0 version of the API by default, and do not support all the types, properties, and APIs available in the beta version. For details about accessing the beta API with the SDK, see [Use the Microsoft Graph SDKs with the beta API](/graph/sdks/use-beta).

 For details about how to [add the SDK](/graph/sdks/sdk-installation) to your project and [create an authProvider](/graph/sdks/choose-authentication-providers) instance, see the [SDK documentation](/graph/sdks/sdks-overview).

#### Response

<!-- { "blockType": "response", "@odata.type": "microsoft.graph.permission" } -->

```http
HTTP/1.1 201 Created
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "id": "123ABC",
  "roles": ["write"],
  "link": {

      "displayName": "Sample Application"
    },
  }
}
```

### Example 3: Creating embeddable links

When using the `embed` link type, the webUrl returned can be embedded in an `<iframe>` HTML element.
When an embed link is created the `webHtml` property contains the HTML code for an `<iframe>` to host the content.

>**Note:** Embed links are only supported for OneDrive personal.

## Remarks

* To create a link based on the organization's default policy and the caller's permissions on the listItem, omit the scope and type parameters
* Links created using this action do not expire unless a default expiration policy is enforced for the organization.
* Links are visible in the sharing permissions for the listItem and can be removed by an owner of the listItem.
* Links always point to the current version of a listItem unless the listItem is checked out (SharePoint only).
