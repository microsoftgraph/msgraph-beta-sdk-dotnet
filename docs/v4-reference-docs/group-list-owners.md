# List group owners

Namespace: microsoft.graph

> [!IMPORTANT]
> APIs under the `/beta` version in Microsoft Graph are subject to change. Use of these APIs in production applications is not supported. To determine whether an API is available in v1.0, use the **Version** selector.

Retrieve a list of the group's owners. The owners are a set of users who are allowed to modify the group object. Owners are currently not available in Microsoft Graph for groups that were created in Exchange or groups that are synchronized from an on-premises environment.

## Permissions

One of the following permissions is required to call this API. To learn more, including how to choose permissions, see [Permissions](/graph/permissions-reference).

| Permission type                        | Permissions (from least to most privileged)                                                              |
| :------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Delegated (work or school account)     | GroupMember.Read.All, Group.Read.All, GroupMember.ReadWrite.All, Group.ReadWrite.All, Directory.Read.All |
| Delegated (personal Microsoft account) | Not supported.                                                                                           |
| Application                            | GroupMember.Read.All, Group.Read.All, GroupMember.ReadWrite.All, Group.ReadWrite.All, Directory.Read.All |


When an application queries a relationship that returns a directoryObject type collection, if it does not have permission to read a certain derived type (like device), members of that type are returned but with limited information. With this behaviour applications can request the least privileged permissions they need, rather than rely on the set of *Directory.** permissions. For details, see [Limited information returned for inaccessible member objects](/graph/permissions-overview#limited-information-returned-for-inaccessible-member-objects).

## HTTP request

<!-- { "blockType": "ignored" } -->

```http
GET /groups/{id}/owners
```

## Optional query parameters

This method supports the `$filter`, `$count`, `$select`, `$search`, and `$expand` [OData query parameters](/graph/query-parameters) to help customize the response. OData cast is also enabled, for example, you can cast to get just the group owners that are users. You can use `$search` on the **displayName** and **description** properties. When items are added or updated for this resource, they are specially indexed for use with the `$count` and `$search` query parameters. There can be a slight delay between when an item is added or updated and when it is available in the index.

## Request headers

| Name          | Type   | Description               |
| :------------ | :----- | :------------------------ |
| Authorization | string | Bearer {token}. Required. |

## Request body

Do not supply a request body for this method.

## Response

If successful, this method returns a `200 OK` response code and collection of [directoryObject](../resources/directoryobject.md) objects in the response body.

## Example

#### Request

The following is an example of the request.

# [HTTP](#tab/http)

<!-- {
  "blockType": "request",
  "name": "group_get_owners"
}-->

```msgraph-interactive
GET https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/groups/{id}/owners
```

# [C#](#tab/csharp)

```csharp

GraphServiceClient graphClient = new GraphServiceClient( authProvider );

var owners = await graphClient.Groups["{group-id}"].Owners
	.Request()
	.GetAsync();

```


 [!IMPORTANT]
 Microsoft Graph SDKs use the v1.0 version of the API by default, and do not support all the types, properties, and APIs available in the beta version. For details about accessing the beta API with the SDK, see [Use the Microsoft Graph SDKs with the beta API](/graph/sdks/use-beta).

 For details about how to [add the SDK](/graph/sdks/sdk-installation) to your project and [create an authProvider](/graph/sdks/choose-authentication-providers) instance, see the [SDK documentation](/graph/sdks/sdks-overview).

#### Response

The following is an example of the response.
