# Create educationSubmissionResource

Namespace: microsoft.graph

> [!IMPORTANT]
> APIs under the `/beta` version in Microsoft Graph are subject to change. Use of these APIs in production applications is not supported. To determine whether an API is available in v1.0, use the **Version** selector.

Add a [educationSubmissionResource](../resources/educationsubmissionresource.md) to a submission resource list.

Only teachers and students can perform this operation.

The operation will not succeed if the **allowStudentsToAddResources** flag is not set to `true`.

To create a new file-based resource, upload the file to the resources folder associated with the submission. If the file doesn't exist or is not in that folder, the POST request will fail.

> [!IMPORTANT] 
> Before you can upload an assignment resource, you must [set up the resources folder](../api/educationassignment-setupresourcesfolder.md) for the [educationAssignment](../resources/educationassignment.md) to upload the files to.

## Permissions
One of the following permissions is required to call this API. To learn more, including how to choose permissions, see [Permissions](/graph/permissions-reference).

|Permission type      | Permissions (from least to most privileged)              |
|:--------------------|:---------------------------------------------------------|
|Delegated (work or school account) |  EduAssignments.ReadWriteBasic, EduAssignments.ReadWrite  |
|Delegated (personal Microsoft account) | Not supported.  |
|Application | Not supported. | 

## HTTP request
<!-- { "blockType": "ignored" } -->
```http
POST /education/classes/{class-id}/assignments/{assignment-id}/submissions/{submission-id}/resources
```

## Request headers
| Header       | Value |
|:---------------|:--------|
| Authorization  | Bearer {token}. Required.  |
| Content-Type  | application/json  |

## Request body
In the request body, supply a JSON representation of the resource. The following are the supported types:

- [educationExcelResource](../resources/educationexcelresource.md)
- [educationFileResource](../resources/educationfileresource.md)
- [educationLinkResource](../resources/educationlinkresource.md)
- [educationPowerPointResource](../resources/educationpowerpointresource.md)
- [educationWordResource](../resources/educationwordresource.md) 
- [educationMediaResource](../resources/educationmediaresource.md).

>**Note:** The [educationExternalResource](../resources/educationexternalresource.md) is only an out resource, you can't POST a submission with it.

The `assignmentResourceUrl` isn't required in the request body, it's a read-only property.

## Response
If successful, this method returns a `201 Created` response code and an object according to the resource type in the response body.

 [!IMPORTANT]
 Microsoft Graph SDKs use the v1.0 version of the API by default, and do not support all the types, properties, and APIs available in the beta version. For details about accessing the beta API with the SDK, see [Use the Microsoft Graph SDKs with the beta API](/graph/sdks/use-beta).

 For details about how to [add the SDK](/graph/sdks/sdk-installation) to your project and [create an authProvider](/graph/sdks/choose-authentication-providers) instance, see the [SDK documentation](/graph/sdks/sdks-overview).
