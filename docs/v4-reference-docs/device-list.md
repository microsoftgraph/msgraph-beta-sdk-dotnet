## HTTP request

<!-- { "blockType": "ignored" } -->
```http
GET /devices
```

## Optional query parameters

This method supports the `$count`, `$expand`, `$filter`, `$orderBy`, `$search`, `$select`, and `$top` [OData query parameters](/graph/query-parameters) to help customize the response. Some queries are supported only when you use the **ConsistencyLevel** header set to `eventual` and `$count`. For more information, see [Advanced query capabilities on Azure AD directory objects](/graph/aad-advanced-queries).

## Request headers

| Name | Description |
|:---- |:----------- |
| Authorization  | Bearer {token}. Required. |
| ConsistencyLevel | eventual. This header and `$count` are required when using `$search`, or in specific usage of `$filter`. For more information about the use of **ConsistencyLevel** and `$count`, see [Advanced query capabilities on Azure AD directory objects](/graph/aad-advanced-queries). |

## Request body

Do not supply a request body for this method.

## Response

If successful, this method returns a `200 OK` response code and collection of [device](../resources/device.md) objects in the response body.

### Example 4: Use $filter and $top to get one device with a display name that starts with 'a' including a count of returned objects

#### Request

The following is an example of the request. This request requires the **ConsistencyLevel** header set to `eventual` and the `$count=true` query string because the request has both the `$orderBy` and `$filter` query parameters. For more information about the use of **ConsistencyLevel** and `$count`, see [Advanced query capabilities on Azure AD directory objects](/graph/aad-advanced-queries).

>**Note:** The `$count` and `$search` query parameters are currently not available in Azure AD B2C tenants.

# [HTTP](#tab/http)
<!-- {
  "blockType": "request",
  "name": "list_devices_startswith"
}-->
```msgraph-interactive
GET https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/devices?$filter=startswith(displayName, 'a')&$count=true&$top=1&$orderby=displayName 
ConsistencyLevel: eventual
```

# [C#](#tab/csharp)

```csharp

GraphServiceClient graphClient = new GraphServiceClient( authProvider );

var queryOptions = new List<QueryOption>()
{
	new QueryOption("$count", "true")
};

var devices = await graphClient.Devices
	.Request( queryOptions )
	.Header("ConsistencyLevel","eventual")
	.Filter("startswith(displayName, 'a')")
	.OrderBy("displayName")
	.Top(1)
	.GetAsync();

```

    }
  ]
}
```

### Example 5: Use $search to get devices with display names that contain the letters 'Android' including a count of returned objects

#### Request

The following is an example of the request. This request requires the **ConsistencyLevel** header set to `eventual` because `$search` and the `$count=true` query string is in the request. For more information about the use of **ConsistencyLevel** and `$count`, see [Advanced query capabilities on Azure AD directory objects](/graph/aad-advanced-queries).

>**Note:** The `$count` and `$search` query parameters are currently not available in Azure AD B2C tenants.

      "operatingSystemVersion":"10.0",
      "hostNames":[]
    }
  ]
}
```

### Example 6: Get devices using filter on extensionAttributes

#### Request

The following is an example of the request. This request requires the **ConsistencyLevel** header set to `eventual` and the `$count=true` query string because the extensionAttributes property supports `$filter` only with advanced query parameters. For more information about the use of **ConsistencyLevel** and `$count`, see [Advanced query capabilities on Azure AD directory objects](/graph/aad-advanced-queries).

>**Note:** The `$count` and `$search` query parameters are currently not available in Azure AD B2C tenants.

# [HTTP](#tab/http)
<!-- {
  "blockType": "request",
  "name": "get_devices_by_extensionAttribute"
}-->
```msgraph-interactive
GET https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/devices?$filter=extensionAttributes/extensionAttribute1 eq 'BYOD-Device'&$count=true
ConsistencyLevel: eventual
```

# [C#](#tab/csharp)

```csharp

GraphServiceClient graphClient = new GraphServiceClient( authProvider );

var queryOptions = new List<QueryOption>()
{
	new QueryOption("$count", "true")
};

var devices = await graphClient.Devices
	.Request( queryOptions )
	.Header("ConsistencyLevel","eventual")
	.Filter("extensionAttributes/extensionAttribute1 eq 'BYOD-Device'")
	.GetAsync();

```
