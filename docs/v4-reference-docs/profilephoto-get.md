# Get profilePhoto

Namespace: microsoft.graph

> [!IMPORTANT]
> APIs under the `/beta` version in Microsoft Graph are subject to change. Use of these APIs in production applications is not supported. To determine whether an API is available in v1.0, use the **Version** selector.

Get the specified [profilePhoto](../resources/profilephoto.md) or its metadata (**profilePhoto** properties) from Microsoft 365.

> **Note**: When attempting to GET a **user** photo, this operation first attempts to retrieve the specified photo from Microsoft 365. If the photo is not available in Microsoft 365, the API attempts to retrieve the photo from Azure Active Directory.

The supported sizes of HD photos in Microsoft 365 are as follows: 48x48, 64x64, 96x96, 120x120, 240x240,
360x360, 432x432, 504x504, and 648x648. Photos can be any dimension if they are stored in Azure Active Directory.

You can get the metadata of the largest available photo, or specify a size to get the metadata for that photo size.
If the size you request is not available, you can still get a smaller size that the user has uploaded and made available.
For example, if the user uploads a photo that is 504x504 pixels, all but the 648x648 size of the photo will be available for download.
If the specified size is not available in the user's mailbox or in Azure Active Directory, the size 1x1 is returned with the rest of the  metadata.

## Permissions
One of the following permissions is required to call this API. To learn more, including how to choose permissions, see [Permissions](/graph/permissions-reference).

> **Note:** The GET photo method in beta supports a user's work, school, or personal accounts. The GET photo metadata method, however, supports only the user's work or school accounts and not personal accounts.

```

#### Response

Contains the binary data of the requested photo. The HTTP response code is 200.

## Using the binary data of the requested photo

When you use the `/photo/$value` endpoint to get the binary data for a profile photo, you'll need to convert the data into a base-64 string in order to add it as an email attachment. The following JavaScript example shows how to create an array that you can pass as the value of the `Attachments` parameter of an [Outlook message](user-post-messages.md).

```javascript
const attachments = [{
  '@odata.type': '#microsoft.graph.fileAttachment',
  ContentBytes: file.toString('base64'),
  Name: 'mypic.jpg'
}];
```

See the [Microsoft Graph Connect Sample for Node.js](https://github.com/microsoftgraph/nodejs-connect-rest-sample) for an implementation of this example.

If you want to display the image on a web page, create an in-memory object from the image and make that object the source of an image element. Here is an example in JavaScript of this operation.

```javascript
const url = window.URL || window.webkitURL;
const blobUrl = url.createObjectURL(image.data);
document.getElementById(imageElement).setAttribute("src", blobUrl);
```
