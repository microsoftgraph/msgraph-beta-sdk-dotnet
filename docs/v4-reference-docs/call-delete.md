# Delete call

Namespace: microsoft.graph

> [!IMPORTANT]
> APIs under the `/beta` version in Microsoft Graph are subject to change. Use of these APIs in production applications is not supported. To determine whether an API is available in v1.0, use the **Version** selector.

Delete or hang up an active call. For group calls, this will only delete your call leg and the underlying group call will still continue.

## Permissions

| Permission type | Permissions (from least to most privileged)                  |
| :-------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
| Delegated (work or school account)     | Not Supported.                         |
| Delegated (personal Microsoft account) | Not Supported.                         |
| Application                            | Calls.Initiate.All, Calls.AccessMedia.All |

> **Note:** Permissions are checked when the call is created; no additional permission check is made when calling this API. Calls.AccessMedia.All is only necessary for calls that use app-hosted media.

## HTTP request
<!-- { "blockType": "ignored" } -->
```http
DELETE /app/calls/{id}
DELETE /communications/calls/{id}

> **Note:** The `/app` path is deprecated. Going forward, use the `/communications` path.

 [!IMPORTANT]
 Microsoft Graph SDKs use the v1.0 version of the API by default, and do not support all the types, properties, and APIs available in the beta version. For details about accessing the beta API with the SDK, see [Use the Microsoft Graph SDKs with the beta API](/graph/sdks/use-beta).

 For details about how to [add the SDK](/graph/sdks/sdk-installation) to your project and [create an authProvider](/graph/sdks/choose-authentication-providers) instance, see the [SDK documentation](/graph/sdks/sdks-overview).
