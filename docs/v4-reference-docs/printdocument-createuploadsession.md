# printDocument: createUploadSession

Namespace: microsoft.graph

> [!IMPORTANT]
> APIs under the `/beta` version in Microsoft Graph are subject to change. Use of these APIs in production applications is not supported. To determine whether an API is available in v1.0, use the **Version** selector.

Create an upload session that allows an app to iteratively upload ranges of a binary file linked to the print document.

As part of the response, this action returns an upload URL that can be used in subsequent sequential `PUT` queries. Request headers for each `PUT` operation can be used to specify the exact range of bytes to be uploaded. This allows transfer to be resumed, in case the network connection is dropped during upload. 

>**Note**: Creating an upload session using application permissions will only succeed if there is a [printTask](../resources/printTask.md) in a `processing` state on the associated print job, started by a trigger that the requesting app created. For details about how to register a task trigger, see [Extending Universal Print to support pull printing](/graph/universal-print-concept-overview#extending-universal-print-to-support-pull-printing).

## Permissions

One of the following permissions is required to call this API. To learn more, including how to choose permissions, see [Permissions](/graph/permissions-reference).
In addition to the following permissions, the user or app's tenant must have an active Universal Print subscription and have a permission that grants [Get printer](printer-get.md) or [Get printerShare](printershare-get.md) access depending upon whether printer or printerShare is being used.

| Permission type                        | Permissions (from least to most privileged) |
|:---------------------------------------|:--------------------------------------------|
| Delegated (work or school account)     | PrintJob.Create, PrintJob.ReadWrite, PrintJob.ReadWrite.All |
| Delegated (personal Microsoft account) | Not Supported. |
| Application                            | PrintJob.ReadWrite.All |

## HTTP request

To create an upload session using **printer**: 

<!-- { "blockType": "ignored" } -->
```http
POST /print/printers/{id}/jobs/{id}/documents/{id}/createUploadSession
```

To create an upload session using **printerShare** (supported with delegated permissions only): 

<!-- { "blockType": "ignored" } -->
```http
POST /print/shares/{id}/jobs/{id}/documents/{id}/createUploadSession
```

## Request headers

| Name          | Description   |
|:--------------|:--------------|
| Authorization | Bearer {token}. Required. |
| Content-type | application/json. Required.|


## Request body

In the request body, provide a JSON object with the following parameters.

| Parameter    | Type        | Description |
|:-------------|:------------|:------------|
|properties|[printDocumentUploadProperties](../resources/printDocumentUploadProperties.md)|Represents properties of the binary file to be uploaded.|

The value of the **contentType** property in the request body should be supported by the printer/printerShare. You can get the supported content types by getting [printerCapabilities](../resources/printercapabilities.md) of the printer/printerShare. 

For **OXPS to PDF** conversion, you need to pass `application/oxps` as contentType for printer/printerShare that supports `application/pdf`. 
Universal Print converts **OXPS to PDF**, when **all** the following conditions are met: 
1.	The printer/printer share supports `application/pdf` in **printerCapabilities**. 
2.	The printer/printer share does NOT support `application/oxps` in **printerCapabilities**. 
3.	The value for the **contentType** property in the request body is `application/oxps`.

## Response

If successful, this method returns a `200 OK` response code and a new [uploadSession](../resources/uploadsession.md) object in the response body.

>**Note**: The **uploadUrl** property returned as part of the **uploadSession** response object is an opaque URL for subsequent `PUT` queries to upload byte ranges of the file. It contains the appropriate auth token for subsequent `PUT` queries that expire by **expirationDateTime**. Do not change this URL.

## Examples

The following example shows how to create an upload session that you can use in subsequent file upload operations to the specified printDocument.

 [!IMPORTANT]
 Microsoft Graph SDKs use the v1.0 version of the API by default, and do not support all the types, properties, and APIs available in the beta version. For details about accessing the beta API with the SDK, see [Use the Microsoft Graph SDKs with the beta API](/graph/sdks/use-beta).

 For details about how to [add the SDK](/graph/sdks/sdk-installation) to your project and [create an authProvider](/graph/sdks/choose-authentication-providers) instance, see the [SDK documentation](/graph/sdks/sdks-overview).
