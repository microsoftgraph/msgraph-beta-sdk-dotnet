## Examples

### Example 1: List all bundles in a drive

To request an enumeration of all bundles defined in the drive, you can make a request to the **bundles** collection without any parameters.

#### Request

The following is an example of a request.

# [HTTP](#tab/http)
<!-- { "blockType": "request", "name": "list-all-bundles", "tags": "service.onedrive" } -->

```msgraph-interactive
GET https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/drive/bundles
```

#### Response

The following is an example of the response.

> **Note**: The response object shown here might be shortened for readability.

<!-- { "blockType": "response", "@odata.type": "microsoft.graph.driveItem", "truncated": true, "isCollection": true } -->

```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-type: application/json

{
  "value": [
    {
      "id": "0123456789abc",
      "name": "Vacation photo album",
      "bundle": {
        "childCount": 1,
        "album": { }
      }
    },
    {
      "id": "0120310201abd",
      "name": "Family shared files",
      "bundle": {
        "childCount": 1
      }
    }
  ],
  "@odata.nextLink": "https://..."
}
```


### Example 2: List all photo albums in a drive

To filter the list of bundles returned from a request to the bundles collection, you can use the `filter` query string parameter to specify the type of bundle to return by checking for the existence of a facet on the bundle.

#### Request

The following is an example of a request.

# [HTTP](#tab/http)
<!-- {"blockType": "request", "name": "list-album-bundles", "tags": "service.onedrive" } -->

```msgraph-interactive
GET https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/drive/bundles?filter=bundle/album%20ne%20null
```

#### Response

The following is an example of the response. The response to a GET to the bundles endpoint is an array of [driveItem][] resources with the [bundle][].
Because all bundles are items, you can use all the standard item operations on them.

> **Note**: The response object shown here might be shortened for readability.

<!-- { "blockType": "response", "@odata.type": "microsoft.graph.driveItem", "truncated": true, "isCollection": true } -->

```http
