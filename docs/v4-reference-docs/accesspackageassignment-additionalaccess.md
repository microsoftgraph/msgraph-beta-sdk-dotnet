# accessPackageAssignment: additionalAccess
Namespace: microsoft.graph

> [!IMPORTANT]
> APIs under the `/beta` version in Microsoft Graph are subject to change. Use of these APIs in production applications is not supported. To determine whether an API is available in v1.0, use the **Version** selector.

In [Azure AD Entitlement Management](../resources/entitlementmanagement-overview.md), retrieve a collection of [accessPackageAssignment](../resources/accesspackageassignment.md) objects that indicate a target user has an assignment to a specified access package and also an assignment to another, potentially incompatible, access package.  This can be used to prepare to configure the incompatible access packages for a specific access package.

## Permissions
One of the following permissions is required to call this API. To learn more, including how to choose permissions, see [Permissions](/graph/permissions-reference).

|Permission type|Permissions (from least to most privileged)|
|:---|:---|
|Delegated (work or school account)|EntitlementManagement.Read.All, EntitlementManagement.ReadWrite.All|
|Delegated (personal Microsoft account)|Not supported.|
|Application|Not supported.|

## HTTP request

<!-- {
  "blockType": "ignored"
}
-->
``` http
GET /identityGovernance/entitlementManagement/accessPackageAssignments/additionalAccess(accessPackageId='parameterValue',incompatibleAccessPackageId='parameterValue')
```

## Function parameters
The following table shows the parameters that must be supplied with this function.  The two access package IDs must be distinct.

|Parameter|Type|Description|
|:---|:---|:---|
| accessPackageId | String |  Indicates the ID of an access package for which the caller would like to retrieve the assignments. Required. |
| incompatibleAccessPackageId | String | The specific incompatible access package for which the caller would like to retrieve only those assignments where the user also has an assignment to this incompatible access package. Required. |

## Optional query parameters

This method supports the `$select`, `$filter`, and `$expand` OData query parameters to help customize the response. For general information, see [OData query parameters](/graph/query-parameters).

## Request headers
|Name|Description|
|:---|:---|
|Authorization|Bearer {token}. Required.|

## Request body
Do not supply a request body for this method.

## Response

If successful, this method returns a `200 OK` response code and a collection of [accessPackageAssignment](../resources/accesspackageassignment.md) objects in the response body.

When a result set spans multiple pages, Microsoft Graph returns that page with an `@odata.nextLink` property in the response that contains a URL to the next page of results. If that property is present, continue making additional requests with the `@odata.nextLink` URL in each response, until all the results are returned. For more information, see [paging Microsoft Graph data in your app](/graph/paging).

## Examples

The following example gets the access package assignments for users who have assignments to both access packages.

```

# [C#](#tab/csharp)

```csharp

GraphServiceClient graphClient = new GraphServiceClient( authProvider );

var additionalAccess = await graphClient.IdentityGovernance.EntitlementManagement.AccessPackageAssignments
	.AdditionalAccess("2506aef1-3929-4d24-a61e-7c8b83d95e6f","d5d99728-8c0b-4ede-83d2-cf9b0e8dabfb")
	.Request()
	.Expand("target")
	.GetAsync();

```


 [!IMPORTANT]
 Microsoft Graph SDKs use the v1.0 version of the API by default, and do not support all the types, properties, and APIs available in the beta version. For details about accessing the beta API with the SDK, see [Use the Microsoft Graph SDKs with the beta API](/graph/sdks/use-beta).

 For details about how to [add the SDK](/graph/sdks/sdk-installation) to your project and [create an authProvider](/graph/sdks/choose-authentication-providers) instance, see the [SDK documentation](/graph/sdks/sdks-overview).
