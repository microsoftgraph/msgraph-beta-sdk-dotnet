Namespace: microsoft.graph

> [!IMPORTANT]
> APIs under the `/beta` version in Microsoft Graph are subject to change. Use of these APIs in production applications is not supported. To determine whether an API is available in v1.0, use the **Version** selector.

List application and service principal objects assigned an [appManagementPolicy](../resources/appManagementPolicy.md) policy object.

## Permissions

One of the following permissions is required to call this API. To learn more, including how to choose permissions, see [Permissions](/graph/permissions-reference).

| Permission type                        | Permissions (from least to most privileged)                                             |
| :------------------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------- |
| Delegated (work or school account)     | Application.Read.All and Policy.Read.All, Application.Read.All and Policy.ReadWrite.ApplicationConfiguration |
| Delegated (personal Microsoft account) | Not supported.                                             |
| Application                            | Application.Read.All and Policy.Read.All, Application.Read.All and Policy.ReadWrite.ApplicationConfiguration |

## HTTP request

<!-- { "blockType": "ignored" } -->

```http
GET /policies/appManagementPolicies/{id}/appliesTo
```

## Optional query parameters

This method supports the `$select`, `$filter`, and `$top` OData query parameters to help customize the response. You can apply `$filter` on properties of [application](../resources/application.md) or [servicePrincipal](../resources/serviceprincipal.md) objects that support `$filter`. For example, the following query retrieves the **appId** and **displayName** of applications or service principals that are assigned the policy.

``` http

https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/policies/appManagementPolicies/{id}/appliesTo?$select=appId,displayName
```

For general information, see [OData query parameters](/graph/query-parameters).

## Request headers

| Name          | Description               |
| :------------ | :------------------------ |
| Authorization | Bearer {token}. Required. |

## Request body

Do not supply a request body for this method.

## Response

If successful, this method returns a `200 OK` response code and a collection of [appManagementPolicy](../resources/appManagementPolicy.md) objects in the response body.

## Examples
