# Update administrativeunit

Namespace: microsoft.graph

> [!IMPORTANT]
> APIs under the `/beta` version in Microsoft Graph are subject to change. Use of these APIs in production applications is not supported. To determine whether an API is available in v1.0, use the **Version** selector.

Update the properties of an [administrativeUnit](../resources/administrativeunit.md) object.
## Permissions
One of the following permissions is required to call this API. To learn more, including how to choose permissions, see [Permissions](/graph/permissions-reference).


|Permission type      | Permissions (from least to most privileged)              |
|:--------------------|:---------------------------------------------------------|
|Delegated (work or school account) | AdministrativeUnit.ReadWrite.All   |
|Delegated (personal Microsoft account) | Not supported.    |
|Application | AdministrativeUnit.ReadWrite.All |

To update an administrative unit, the calling principal must be assigned one of the following [Azure AD roles](/azure/active-directory/roles/permissions-reference):

* Privileged Role Administrator
* Global Administrator

## HTTP request
<!-- { "blockType": "ignored" } -->
```http
PATCH /administrativeUnits/{id}
PATCH /directory/administrativeUnits/{id}
```

## Request headers

| Name      |Description|
|:----------|:----------|
| Authorization  | Bearer {token}. Required. |

## Request body

In the request body, supply the values for relevant fields that should be updated. Existing properties that are not included in the request body will maintain their previous values or be recalculated based on changes to other property values. For best performance you shouldn't include existing values that haven't changed.

| Property   | Type |Description|
|:---------------|:--------|:----------|
| description | String | Description for the administrative unit.|
| displayName | String | Display name for the administrative unit. |
| membershipRule | String | Dynamic membership rule for the administrative unit. For more about the rules that you can use for dynamic administrative units and dynamic groups, see [Using attributes to create advanced rules](https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/articles/active-directory-accessmanagement-groups-with-advanced-rules/).|
| membershipRuleProcessingState | String | Used to control whether the dynamic membership rule is actively processed. Set to `On` when you want the dynamic membership rule to be active and `Paused` if you want to stop updating membership dynamically. |
| membershipType | String | Membership type for the administrative unit. Can be `dynamic` or `assigned`. |
| visibility | String | Visibility for the administrative unit. If not set, then the default is `public`. Can be set to `HiddenMembership`, which hides the membership from non-members. |

Since the **administrativeUnit** resource supports [extensions](/graph/extensibility-overview), you can use the `PATCH` operation to add, update, or delete your own app-specific data in custom properties of an extension in an existing **administrativeUnit** instance.

## Response

If successful, this method returns a `204 No Content` response code.

## Example
The following example sets a dynamic membership rule on an existing administrative unit to include all users whose country is United States.

 [!IMPORTANT]
 Microsoft Graph SDKs use the v1.0 version of the API by default, and do not support all the types, properties, and APIs available in the beta version. For details about accessing the beta API with the SDK, see [Use the Microsoft Graph SDKs with the beta API](/graph/sdks/use-beta).

 For details about how to [add the SDK](/graph/sdks/sdk-installation) to your project and [create an authProvider](/graph/sdks/choose-authentication-providers) instance, see the [SDK documentation](/graph/sdks/sdks-overview).

### Response
