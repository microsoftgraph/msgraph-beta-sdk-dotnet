# group: evaluateDynamicMembership

Namespace: microsoft.graph

> [!IMPORTANT]
> APIs under the `/beta` version in Microsoft Graph are subject to change. Use of these APIs in production applications is not supported. To determine whether an API is available in v1.0, use the **Version** selector.

Evaluate whether a user or device is or would be a member of a dynamic group. The membership rule is returned along with other details that were used in the evaluation. You can complete this operation in the following ways:

- Evaluate whether a user or device is a member of a specified dynamic group.
- Evaluate whether a user or device would be a member of a dynamic group based on the ID of the user or device and a membership rule.

## Permissions

One of the following permissions is required to call this API. To learn more, including how to choose permissions, see [Permissions](/graph/permissions-reference).

### Evaluate dynamic membership with member ID and group ID

| memberId       | String collection | memberId is the object Id of the user or device to be evaluated.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| membershipRule | String collection | The rule that is used for membership evaluation. If this property is not provided, the rule for the existing group is evaluated.
