# List submissions

Namespace: microsoft.graph

> [!IMPORTANT]
> APIs under the `/beta` version in Microsoft Graph are subject to change. Use of these APIs in production applications is not supported. To determine whether an API is available in v1.0, use the **Version** selector.

List all the [submissions](../resources/educationsubmission.md) associated with an [assignment](../resources/educationassignment.md). Only teachers, students, and applications with application permissions can perform this operation.

A teacher or an application with application permissions can get all the **submissions**, a student can only get **submissions** that they are associated with.

Provide the header `Prefer: include-unknown-enum-members` to properly list **submissions** with the `reassigned` status. For details, see the examples section.

## Permissions
One of the following permissions is required to call this API. To learn more, including how to choose permissions, see [Permissions](/graph/permissions-reference).

|Permission type      | Permissions (from least to most privileged)              |
|:--------------------|:---------------------------------------------------------|
|Delegated (work or school account) |  EduAssignments.ReadBasic, EduAssignments.ReadWriteBasic, EduAssignments.Read, EduAssignments.ReadWrite  |
|Delegated (personal Microsoft account) |  Not supported.  |
|Application | EduAssignments.ReadBasic.All, EduAssignments.ReadWriteBasic.All, EduAssignments.Read.All, EduAssignments.ReadWrite.All | 

## HTTP request
<!-- { "blockType": "ignored" } -->
```http
GET /education/classes/{class-id}/assignments/{assignment-id}/submissions
```

## Optional query parameters

This method supports the `$filter`,'$top', and `$select` OData query parameters to help customize the response. For general information, see [OData query parameters](/graph/query-parameters).

## Request headers
| Header       | Value |
|:---------------|:--------|
| Authorization  | Bearer {token}. Required.  |
| Prefer  | `include-unknown-enum-members`. Optional.  |

## Request body
Don't supply a request body for this method.

## Response
If successful, this method returns a `200 OK` response code and collection of [educationSubmission](../resources/educationsubmission.md) objects in the response body.

## Examples

 [!IMPORTANT]
 Microsoft Graph SDKs use the v1.0 version of the API by default, and do not support all the types, properties, and APIs available in the beta version. For details about accessing the beta API with the SDK, see [Use the Microsoft Graph SDKs with the beta API](/graph/sdks/use-beta).

 For details about how to [add the SDK](/graph/sdks/sdk-installation) to your project and [create an authProvider](/graph/sdks/choose-authentication-providers) instance, see the [SDK documentation](/graph/sdks/sdks-overview).
