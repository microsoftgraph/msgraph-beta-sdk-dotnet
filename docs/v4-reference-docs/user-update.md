# Update user

Namespace: microsoft.graph

> [!IMPORTANT]
> APIs under the `/beta` version in Microsoft Graph are subject to change. Use of these APIs in production applications is not supported. To determine whether an API is available in v1.0, use the **Version** selector.

Update the properties of a [user](../resources/user.md) object. Not all properties can be updated by Member or Guest users with their default permissions without Administrator roles. [Compare member and guest default permissions](/azure/active-directory/fundamentals/users-default-permissions?context=graph/context#compare-member-and-guest-default-permissions) to see properties they can manage.

## Permissions
One of the following permissions is required to call this API. To learn more, including how to choose permissions, see [Permissions](/graph/permissions-reference).

|Permission type      | Permissions (from least to most privileged)              |
|:--------------------|:---------------------------------------------------------|
|Delegated (work or school account) | User.ReadWrite, User.ManageIdentities.All, User.EnableDisableAccount.All, User.ReadWrite.All, Directory.ReadWrite.All    |
|Delegated (personal Microsoft account) | User.ReadWrite    |
|Application | User.ManageIdentities.All, User.EnableDisableAccount.All, User.ReadWrite.All, Directory.ReadWrite.All |

>[!NOTE]
> - To update sensitive user properties, such as **accountEnabled**, **mobilePhone**, and **otherMails** for users with privileged administrator roles, the app must be assigned the *Directory.AccessAsUser.All* delegated permission, and the calling user must have a higher privileged administrator role as indicated in [Who can perform sensitive actions](../resources/users.md#who-can-perform-sensitive-actions).
> - Your personal Microsoft account must be tied to an Azure AD tenant to update your profile with the *User.ReadWrite* delegated permission on a personal Microsoft account.
> - Updating the **identities** property requires the *User.ManageIdentities.All* permission. Also, adding a [B2C local account](../resources/objectidentity.md) to an existing **user** object is not allowed, unless the **user** object already contains a local account identity.

## HTTP request
<!-- { "blockType": "ignored" } -->
```http
PATCH /users/{id | userPrincipalName}
```

## Request headers
| Header       | Value|
|:-----------|:------|
| Authorization  | Bearer {token}. Required.  |
| Content-Type  | application/json  |

## Request body
In the request body, supply the values for relevant fields that should be updated. Existing properties that are not included in the request body will maintain their previous values or be recalculated based on changes to other property values.

|customSecurityAttributes|[customSecurityAttributeValue](../resources/customsecurityattributevalue.md)|An open complex type that holds the value of a custom security attribute that is assigned to a directory object.<br/><br/>To update this property, the calling principal must be assigned the Attribute Assignment Administrator role and must be granted the *CustomSecAttributeAssignment.ReadWrite.All* permission.|
|department|String|The name for the department in which the user works.|
|displayName|String|The name displayed in the address book for the user. This is usually the combination of the user's first name, middle initial and last name. This property is required when a user is created and it cannot be cleared during updates.|

The timestamp type represents date and time information using ISO 8601 format and is always in UTC time. For example, midnight UTC on Jan 1, 2014 is `2014-01-01T00:00:00Z`.<br><br> Requires User-LifeCycleInfo.ReadWrite.All. For delegated scenarios, the admin needs the Global Administrator [Azure AD role](/azure/active-directory/roles/permissions-reference). |
|identities|[objectIdentity](../resources/objectidentity.md) collection| Represents the identities that can be used to sign in to this user account. An identity can be provided by Microsoft, by organizations, or by social identity providers such as Facebook, Google, and Microsoft, and tied to a user account. Any update to **identities** will replace the entire collection and you must supply the userPrincipalName **signInType** identity in the collection.|
|interests|String collection|A list for the user to describe their interests.|

These extension attributes are also known as Exchange custom attributes 1-15.|
|onPremisesImmutableId|String|This property is used to associate an on-premises Active Directory user account to their Azure AD user object. This property must be specified when creating a new user account in the Graph if you are using a federated domain for the user’s **userPrincipalName** (UPN) property. **Important:** The **$** and **_** characters cannot be used when specifying this property.                            |
|otherMails|String collection|A list of additional email addresses for the user; for example: `["bob@contoso.com", "Robert@fabrikam.com"]`.|
|passwordPolicies|String|Specifies password policies for the user. This value is an enumeration with one possible value being `DisableStrongPassword`, which allows weaker passwords than the default policy to be specified. `DisablePasswordExpiration` can also be specified. The two may be specified together; for example: `DisablePasswordExpiration, DisableStrongPassword`.|

As a best practice, always set the **forceChangePasswordNextSignIn** to `true`. The password in the profile must satisfy minimum requirements as specified by the **passwordPolicies** property. By default, a strong password is required. <br><br> In delegated access, the calling app must be assigned the *Directory.AccessAsUser.All* delegated permission on behalf of the signed-in user.

|userPrincipalName|String|The user principal name (UPN) of the user. The UPN is an Internet-style login name for the user based on the Internet standard RFC 822. By convention, this should map to the user's email name. The general format is alias@domain, where domain must be present in the tenant's collection of verified domains. The verified domains for the tenant can be accessed from the **verifiedDomains** property of [organization](../resources/organization.md). <br>NOTE: This property cannot contain accent characters. Only the following characters are allowed `A - Z`, `a - z`, `0 - 9`, ` ' . - _ ! # ^ ~`.

|userType|String|A string value that can be used to classify user types in your directory, such as `Member` and `Guest`.          |

Because the **user** resource supports [extensions](/graph/extensibility-overview), you can use the `PATCH` operation to 
add, update, or delete your own app-specific data in custom properties of an extension in an existing **user** instance.

> [!NOTE] 
> - The following properties cannot be updated by an app with only application permissions: **aboutMe**, **birthday**, **employeeHireDate**, **interests**, **mySite**, **pastProjects**, **responsibilities**, **schools**, and **skills**.
> - To update the following properties, you must specify them in their own PATCH request, without including the other properties listed in the table above: **aboutMe**, **birthday**, **interests**, **mySite**, **pastProjects**, **responsibilities**, **schools**, and **skills**.

### Manage extensions and associated data

Use this API to manage the directory, schema, and open extensions and their data for users, as follows:

+ Add, update and store data in the extensions for an existing user
+ For directory and schema extensions, remove any stored data by setting the value of the custom extension property to `null`. For open extensions, use the [Delete open extension](/graph/api/opentypeextension-delete) API.

## Response

If successful, this method returns a `204 No Content` response code.
