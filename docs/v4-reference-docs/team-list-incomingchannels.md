# List incomingChannels
Namespace: microsoft.graph

> [!IMPORTANT]
> APIs under the `/beta` version in Microsoft Graph are subject to change. Use of these APIs in production applications is not supported. To determine whether an API is available in v1.0, use the **Version** selector.

Get the list of incoming [channels](../resources/channel.md) (channels shared with a [team](../resources/team.md)).

## Permissions
One of the following permissions is required to call this API. To learn more, including how to choose permissions, see [Permissions](/graph/permissions-reference).

|Permission type|Permissions (from least to most privileged)|
|:---|:---|
|Delegated (work or school account) | Channel.ReadBasic.All, ChannelSettings.Read.All, ChannelSettings.ReadWrite.All |
|Delegated (personal Microsoft account) | Not supported.    |
|Application | Channel.ReadBasic.All, ChannelSettings.Read.All, ChannelSettings.ReadWrite.All |

> **Note**: This API supports admin permissions. Global admins and Microsoft Teams service admins can access teams that they are not a member of.

## HTTP request

<!-- {
  "blockType": "ignored"
}
-->
``` http
GET /teams/{team-id}/incomingChannels
```

## Optional query parameters
This method supports the `$filter` and `$select` [OData query parameters](/graph/query-parameters) to help customize the response.

## Request headers
|Name|Description|
|:---|:---|
|Authorization|Bearer {token}. Required.|

## Request body
Do not supply a request body for this method.

## Response

If successful, this method returns a `200 OK` response code and a collection of [channel](../resources/channel.md) objects in the response body. The response also includes the **@odata.id** property which can be used to access the channel and run other operations on the [channel](../resources/channel.md) object.

> [!Note]
> Currently, invoking the URL returned from the **@odata.id** property fails for cross-tenant shared channels. You can solve this issue if you remove the `/tenants/{tenant-id}` part from the URL before you call this API. For more details, see [Known issues with Microsoft Graph](/graph/known-issues#unable-to-access-a-cross-tenant-shared-channel-when-the-request-url-contains-tenantscross-tenant-id).

 [!IMPORTANT]
 Microsoft Graph SDKs use the v1.0 version of the API by default, and do not support all the types, properties, and APIs available in the beta version. For details about accessing the beta API with the SDK, see [Use the Microsoft Graph SDKs with the beta API](/graph/sdks/use-beta).

 For details about how to [add the SDK](/graph/sdks/sdk-installation) to your project and [create an authProvider](/graph/sdks/choose-authentication-providers) instance, see the [SDK documentation](/graph/sdks/sdks-overview).
