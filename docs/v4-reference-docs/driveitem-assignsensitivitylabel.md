Asynchronously assign a sensitivity label to a [driveItem][item-resource]. 

This API is part of Microsoft SharePoint and OneDrive APIs that perform advanced premium administrative functions and is considered a protected API. Protected APIs require you to have additional validation, beyond permission and consent, before you can use them. 

For more information about sensitivity labels from an administrator's perspective, see [Enable sensitivity labels for Office files in SharePoint and OneDrive](/microsoft-365/compliance/sensitivity-labels-sharepoint-onedrive-files?view=o365-worldwide&preserve-view=true).

> [!NOTE]

## Response

If successful, the API returns a `202 Accepted` HTTP response code with an empty response body. The `Location` header provides the URL to get operation details.
For more details about how to monitor the progress of an assign sensitivity label operation, see [monitoring long-running operations](/graph/long-running-actions-overview).

In addition to general errors that apply to Microsoft Graph, this API returns the `423 Locked` response code, which indicates that the file being accessed is locked. In such cases, the **code** property of the response object indicates the error type that blocks the operation.
Also, Few Irm Protected sensitivity labels cannot be updated by Application and need delegated user access to validate if the user has proper rights, For these scenario the API will throw `Not Supported` response code.

The following table lists the possible values for the error types.

| Value                       | Description                                                                                                         |
|:----------------------------|:--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| fileDoubleKeyEncrypted      | Indicates that the file is protected via double key encryption; therefore, it cannot be opened.                          |
| fileDecryptionNotSupported  | Indicates that the encrypted file has specific properties that do not allow these files to be opened by SharePoint.|
| fileDecryptionDeferred      | Indicates that the file is being processed for decryption; therefore, it cannot be opened.                               |
| unknownFutureValue          | Evolvable enumeration sentinel value. Do not use.                                                                   |

``` http
POST https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/drive/root/items/016GVDAP3RCQS5VBQHORFIVU2ZMOSBL25U/assignSensitivityLabel
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "sensitivityLabelId": "5feba255-812e-446a-ac59-a7044ef827b5",
  "assignmentMethod": "standard",
  "justificationText": "test_justification"
}
```



### Response

The following is an example of the response.

<!-- { "blockType": "response" } -->
```http
HTTP/1.1 202 Accepted
Location: https://contoso.sharepoint.com/_api/v2.0/monitor/QXNzaWduU2Vuc2l0aXZpdHlMYWJlbCxiMzc3ODY3OS04OWQ3LTRkYmYtYjg0MC1jYWM1NzRhY2FlNmE?tempAuth=eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhb....
```
The value of the `Location` header provides a URL for a service that will return the current state of the assign sensitivity label operation.
You can use this information to [determine when the assign sensitivity label operation has finished](/graph/long-running-actions-overview).

### Remarks
The response from the API only indicates that the assign sensitivity label operation was accepted or rejected. The operation might be rejected, for example, if the file type is not supported, or the file is double encrypted.
