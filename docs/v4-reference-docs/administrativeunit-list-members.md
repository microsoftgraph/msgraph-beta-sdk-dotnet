# List members

Namespace: microsoft.graph

> [!IMPORTANT]
> APIs under the `/beta` version in Microsoft Graph are subject to change. Use of these APIs in production applications is not supported. To determine whether an API is available in v1.0, use the **Version** selector.

Use this API to get the members list (users, groups, and devices) in an administrative unit.

## Permissions
One of the following permissions is required to call this API. To learn more, including how to choose permissions, see [Permissions](/graph/permissions-reference).

|Permission type      | Permissions (from least to most privileged)              |
|:--------------------|:---------------------------------------------------------|
|Delegated (work or school account) | AdministrativeUnit.Read.All, Directory.Read.All, AdministrativeUnit.ReadWrite.All, Directory.ReadWrite.All    |
|Delegated (personal Microsoft account) | Not supported.    |
|Application | AdministrativeUnit.Read.All, Directory.Read.All, AdministrativeUnit.ReadWrite.All, Directory.ReadWrite.All |

> Note: To list the members of a hidden membership in an administrative unit, the Member.Read.Hidden permission is required.


When an application queries a relationship that returns a directoryObject type collection, if it does not have permission to read a certain derived type (like device), members of that type are returned but with limited information. With this behaviour applications can request the least privileged permissions they need, rather than rely on the set of *Directory.** permissions. For details, see [Limited information returned for inaccessible member objects](/graph/permissions-overview#limited-information-returned-for-inaccessible-member-objects).

## HTTP request

```http
GET /administrativeUnits/{id}/members
GET /administrativeUnits/{id}/members/$ref
```
## Optional query parameters
This method (when used without `$ref`) supports the [OData query parameters](/graph/query-parameters) to help customize the response, including `$search`, `$count`, and `$filter`. OData cast is also enabled, for example, you can cast to get just the users that are a member of the administrative unit. 

`$search` is supported on the **displayName** and **description** properties only. Some queries are supported only when you use the **ConsistencyLevel** header set to `eventual` and `$count`. For more information, see [Advanced query capabilities on Azure AD directory objects](/graph/aad-advanced-queries).

## Request headers
| Header      |Value|
|:----------|:----------|
| Authorization  | Bearer {token}. Required. |
| ConsistencyLevel  | eventual. This header and `$count` are required when using `$search`, or in specific usage of `$filter`. For more information about the use of **ConsistencyLevel** and `$count`, see [Advanced query capabilities on Azure AD directory objects](/graph/aad-advanced-queries). |

## Request body
Do not supply a request body for this method.

## Response

If successful, this method returns a `200 OK` response code and a collection of [user](../resources/user.md), [group](../resources/group.md), or [device](../resources/device.md) objects in the response body. Adding `$ref` at the end of the request returns a collection of only `@odata.id` URLs of the members.
