# List recoveryKeys
Namespace: microsoft.graph

> [!IMPORTANT]
> APIs under the `/beta` version in Microsoft Graph are subject to change. Use of these APIs in production applications is not supported. To determine whether an API is available in v1.0, use the **Version** selector.

Get a list of the [bitlockerRecoveryKey](../resources/bitlockerrecoverykey.md) objects and their properties. 

This operation does not return the **key** property. For information about how to read the **key** property, see [Get bitlockerRecoveryKey](bitlockerrecoverykey-get.md).

## Permissions
One of the following permissions is required to call this API. To learn more, including how to choose permissions, see [Permissions](/graph/permissions-reference).

|Permission type|Permissions (from least to most privileged)|
|:---|:---|
|Delegated (work or school account)|BitLockerKey.ReadBasic.All, BitLockerKey.Read.All|
|Delegated (personal Microsoft account)|Not supported.|
|Application|Not supported.|

For delegated permissions to allow apps to get **bitLockerRecoveryKey** resources on behalf of the signed-in user, the user must be the registered owner of the device that the BitLocker recovery key was originally backed up from, or the calling user must be in one of the following directory roles:

* Global administrator
* Cloud device administrator
* Helpdesk administrator
* Intune service administrator
* Security administrator
* Security reader
* Global reader

## HTTP request
To get a list of BitLocker keys within the tenant:

<!-- {
  "blockType": "ignored"
}
-->
``` http
GET /informationProtection/bitlocker/recoveryKeys
```

To get a list of BitLocker keys within the tenant filtered by the **deviceId**:

<!-- {
  "blockType": "ignored"
}
-->
``` http
GET /informationProtection/bitlocker/recoveryKeys?$filter=deviceId eq '{deviceId}'
```

## Optional query parameters
This method supports the `$filter` OData query parameter to filter results by the **deviceId** the key was most recently backed up to. This method does not support the `$top` filter. For details, see [Example 2](#example-2-retrieve-a-list-of-bitlocker-keys-filtered-by-deviceid). For general information, see [OData query parameters](/graph/query-parameters).

The response might also contain an `odata.nextLink`, which you can use to page through the result set. For details, see [Paging Microsoft Graph data](/graph/paging).

## Request headers
|Name|Description|
|:---|:---|
|Authorization|Bearer {token}. Required.|
|User-Agent|The identifier for the calling application. This value contains information about the operating system and the browser used. Required.|
|ocp-client-name|The name of the client application performing the API call. This header is used for debugging purposes. Optional.|
|ocp-client-version|The version of the client application performing the API call. This header is used for debugging purposes. Optional.|

## Response

If successful, this method returns a `200 OK` response code and a collection of [bitlockerRecoveryKey](../resources/bitlockerrecoverykey.md) objects in the response body.
