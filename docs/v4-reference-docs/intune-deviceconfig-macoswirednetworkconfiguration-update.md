## HTTP Request
<!-- {
  "blockType": "ignored"
}
-->
``` http
PATCH /deviceManagement/deviceConfigurations/{deviceConfigurationId}
PATCH /deviceManagement/deviceConfigurations/{deviceConfigurationId}/groupAssignments/{deviceConfigurationGroupAssignmentId}/deviceConfiguration
PATCH /deviceManagement/deviceConfigurations/{deviceConfigurationId}/microsoft.graph.windowsDomainJoinConfiguration/networkAccessConfigurations/{deviceConfigurationId}
```

## Request headers
|Header|Value|
|:---|:---|
|Authorization|Bearer &lt;token&gt; Required.|
|Accept|application/json|

## Request body
In the request body, supply a JSON representation for the [macOSWiredNetworkConfiguration](../resources/intune-deviceconfig-macoswirednetworkconfiguration.md) object.

The following table shows the properties that are required when you create the [macOSWiredNetworkConfiguration](../resources/intune-deviceconfig-macoswirednetworkconfiguration.md).

|Property|Type|Description|
|:---|:---|:---|
|id|String|Key of the entity. Inherited from [deviceConfiguration](../resources/intune-shared-deviceconfiguration.md)|
|lastModifiedDateTime|DateTimeOffset|DateTime the object was last modified. Inherited from [deviceConfiguration](../resources/intune-shared-deviceconfiguration.md)|
|roleScopeTagIds|String collection|List of Scope Tags for this Entity instance. Inherited from [deviceConfiguration](../resources/intune-shared-deviceconfiguration.md)|
|supportsScopeTags|Boolean|Indicates whether or not the underlying Device Configuration supports the assignment of scope tags. Assigning to the ScopeTags property is not allowed when this value is false and entities will not be visible to scoped users. This occurs for Legacy policies created in Silverlight and can be resolved by deleting and recreating the policy in the Azure Portal. This property is read-only. Inherited from [deviceConfiguration](../resources/intune-shared-deviceconfiguration.md)|
|deviceManagementApplicabilityRuleOsEdition|[deviceManagementApplicabilityRuleOsEdition](../resources/intune-deviceconfig-devicemanagementapplicabilityruleosedition.md)|The OS edition applicability for this Policy. Inherited from [deviceConfiguration](../resources/intune-shared-deviceconfiguration.md)|
|deviceManagementApplicabilityRuleOsVersion|[deviceManagementApplicabilityRuleOsVersion](../resources/intune-deviceconfig-devicemanagementapplicabilityruleosversion.md)|The OS version applicability rule for this Policy. Inherited from [deviceConfiguration](../resources/intune-shared-deviceconfiguration.md)|
|deviceManagementApplicabilityRuleDeviceMode|[deviceManagementApplicabilityRuleDeviceMode](../resources/intune-deviceconfig-devicemanagementapplicabilityruledevicemode.md)|The device mode applicability rule for this Policy. Inherited from [deviceConfiguration](../resources/intune-shared-deviceconfiguration.md)|
|createdDateTime|DateTimeOffset|DateTime the object was created. Inherited from [deviceConfiguration](../resources/intune-shared-deviceconfiguration.md)|
|description|String|Admin provided description of the Device Configuration. Inherited from [deviceConfiguration](../resources/intune-shared-deviceconfiguration.md)|
|displayName|String|Admin provided name of the device configuration. Inherited from [deviceConfiguration](../resources/intune-shared-deviceconfiguration.md)|
|version|Int32|Version of the device configuration. Inherited from [deviceConfiguration](../resources/intune-shared-deviceconfiguration.md)|
|networkName|String|Network Name|
|networkInterface|[wiredNetworkInterface](../resources/intune-deviceconfig-wirednetworkinterface.md)|Network interface. Possible values are: `anyEthernet`, `firstActiveEthernet`, `secondActiveEthernet`, `thirdActiveEthernet`, `firstEthernet`, `secondEthernet`, `thirdEthernet`.|
|eapType|[eapType](../resources/intune-deviceconfig-eaptype.md)|Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP). Indicates the type of EAP protocol set on the wired network. Possible values are: `eapTls`, `leap`, `eapSim`, `eapTtls`, `peap`, `eapFast`, `teap`.|
|eapFastConfiguration|[eapFastConfiguration](../resources/intune-deviceconfig-eapfastconfiguration.md)|EAP-FAST Configuration Option when EAP-FAST is the selected EAP Type. Possible values are: `noProtectedAccessCredential`, `useProtectedAccessCredential`, `useProtectedAccessCredentialAndProvision`, `useProtectedAccessCredentialAndProvisionAnonymously`.|
|trustedServerCertificateNames|String collection|Trusted server certificate names when EAP Type is configured to EAP-TLS/TTLS/FAST or PEAP. This is the common name used in the certificates issued by your trusted certificate authority (CA). If you provide this information, you can bypass the dynamic trust dialog that is displayed on end users devices when they connect to this wired network.|
|authenticationMethod|[wiFiAuthenticationMethod](../resources/intune-deviceconfig-wifiauthenticationmethod.md)|Authentication Method when EAP Type is configured to PEAP or EAP-TTLS. Possible values are: `certificate`, `usernameAndPassword`, `derivedCredential`.|
|nonEapAuthenticationMethodForEapTtls|[nonEapAuthenticationMethodForEapTtlsType](../resources/intune-deviceconfig-noneapauthenticationmethodforeapttlstype.md)|Non-EAP Method for Authentication (Inner Identity) when EAP Type is EAP-TTLS and Authenticationmethod is Username and Password. Possible values are: `unencryptedPassword`, `challengeHandshakeAuthenticationProtocol`, `microsoftChap`, `microsoftChapVersionTwo`.|
|enableOuterIdentityPrivacy|String|Enable identity privacy (Outer Identity) when EAP Type is configured to EAP-TTLS, EAP-FAST or PEAP. This property masks usernames with the text you enter. For example, if you use 'anonymous', each user that authenticates with this wired network using their real username is displayed as 'anonymous'.|



## Response
If successful, this method returns a `200 OK` response code and an updated [macOSWiredNetworkConfiguration](../resources/intune-deviceconfig-macoswirednetworkconfiguration.md) object in the response body.
