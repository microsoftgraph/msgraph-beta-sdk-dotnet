# List printJobs for a printer

Namespace: microsoft.graph

> [!IMPORTANT]
> APIs under the `/beta` version in Microsoft Graph are subject to change. Use of these APIs in production applications is not supported. To determine whether an API is available in v1.0, use the **Version** selector.

Retrieve a list of print jobs associated with the [printer](../resources/printer.md).

## Permissions
One of the following permissions is required to call this API. To learn more, including how to choose permissions, see [Permissions](/graph/permissions-reference).

To use the Universal Print service, the user or app's tenant must have an active Universal Print subscription, a permission that grants [Get printer](printer-get.md) access, and one of the permissions listed in the following table. The signed in user must be a [Printer Administrator](/azure/active-directory/users-groups-roles/directory-assign-admin-roles#printer-administrator).

To read print jobs from another user, the signed in user needs to be a print administrator and have the PrintJob.ReadBasic.All, PrintJob.Read.All, PrintJob.ReadWriteBasic.All, or PrintJob.ReadWrite.All permission.

|Permission type | Permissions (from least to most privileged) |
|:---------------|:--------------------------------------------|
|Delegated (work or school account)| PrintJob.ReadBasic, PrintJob.Read, PrintJob.ReadBasic.All, PrintJob.Read.All, PrintJob.ReadWriteBasic, PrintJob.ReadWrite, PrintJob.ReadWriteBasic.All, PrintJob.ReadWrite.All |
|Delegated (personal Microsoft account)|Not Supported.|
|Application| PrintJob.ReadBasic.All, PrintJob.Read.All, PrintJob.ReadWriteBasic.All, PrintJob.ReadWrite.All |

## HTTP request
<!-- { "blockType": "ignored" } -->
```http
GET /print/printers/{id}/jobs
```

## Optional query parameters
This method supports some of the OData query parameters to help customize the response. For general information, see [OData query parameters](/graph/query-parameters).

* The **documents** property is omitted from the response by default. To also return a list of [printDocuments](../resources/printdocument.md) for each print job, use `$expand=documents`.
* This method supports filtering print jobs by the user who created them. Use `$filter=createdBy/userPrincipalName eq '{upn}'`, where **{upn}** is the [user principal name](/azure/active-directory/hybrid/plan-connect-userprincipalname#what-is-userprincipalname) of the associated user.

### Exceptions
Some operators are not supported: `$count`, `$search`.

 [!IMPORTANT]
 Microsoft Graph SDKs use the v1.0 version of the API by default, and do not support all the types, properties, and APIs available in the beta version. For details about accessing the beta API with the SDK, see [Use the Microsoft Graph SDKs with the beta API](/graph/sdks/use-beta).

 For details about how to [add the SDK](/graph/sdks/sdk-installation) to your project and [create an authProvider](/graph/sdks/choose-authentication-providers) instance, see the [SDK documentation](/graph/sdks/sdks-overview).
