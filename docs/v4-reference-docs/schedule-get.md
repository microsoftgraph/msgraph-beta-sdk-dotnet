# Get schedule

Namespace: microsoft.graph

> [!IMPORTANT]
> APIs under the `/beta` version in Microsoft Graph are subject to change. Use of these APIs in production applications is not supported. To determine whether an API is available in v1.0, use the **Version** selector.

Retrieve the properties and relationships of a [schedule](../resources/schedule.md) object.

The schedule creation process conforms to the [One API guideline for resource based long running operations (RELO)](https://github.com/Microsoft/api-guidelines/blob/master/Guidelines.md#131-resource-based-long-running-operations-relo).
When clients use the [PUT method](team-put-schedule.md), if the schedule is provisioned, the operation updates the schedule; otherwise, the operation starts the schedule provisioning process in the background.

During schedule provisioning, clients can use the GET method to get the schedule and look at the `provisionStatus` property for the current state of the provisioning. If the provisioning failed, clients can get additional information from the `provisionStatusCode` property.

Clients can also inspect the configuration of the schedule.

 [!IMPORTANT]
 Microsoft Graph SDKs use the v1.0 version of the API by default, and do not support all the types, properties, and APIs available in the beta version. For details about accessing the beta API with the SDK, see [Use the Microsoft Graph SDKs with the beta API](/graph/sdks/use-beta).

 For details about how to [add the SDK](/graph/sdks/sdk-installation) to your project and [create an authProvider](/graph/sdks/choose-authentication-providers) instance, see the [SDK documentation](/graph/sdks/sdks-overview).
