# Update alert

Namespace: microsoft.graph

> [!IMPORTANT]
> APIs under the `/beta` version in Microsoft Graph are subject to change. Use of these APIs in production applications is not supported. To determine whether an API is available in v1.0, use the **Version** selector.

Update an editable **alert** property within any integrated solution to keep alert status and assignments in sync across solutions. This method updates any solution that has a record of the referenced alert ID.

## Permissions

One of the following permissions is required to call this API. To learn more, including how to choose permissions, see [Permissions](/graph/permissions-reference).

|Permission type      | Permissions (from least to most privileged)              |
|:--------------------|:---------------------------------------------------------|
|Delegated (work or school account) |   SecurityEvents.ReadWrite.All  |
|Delegated (personal Microsoft account) |  Not supported.  |
|Application | SecurityEvents.ReadWrite.All |

## HTTP request

> **Note:** You must include the **alert** ID as a parameter and **vendorInformation** containing the `provider` and `vendor` with this method.
<!-- { "blockType": "ignored" } -->

```http
PATCH /security/alerts/{alert_id}
```

## Request headers

| Name       | Description|
|:-----------|:-----------|
| Authorization  | Bearer {code}. Required.|
|Prefer | return=representation. Optional. |

## Request body

In the request body, supply a JSON representation of the values for relevant fields that should be updated. The body **must** contain the **vendorInformation** property with valid `provider` and `vendor` fields. The following table lists the fields that can be updated for an alert. The values for existing properties that are not included in the request body will not change. For best performance, don't include existing values that haven't changed.

| Property   | Type |Description|
|:---------------|:--------|:----------|
|assignedTo|String|Name of the analyst the alert is assigned to for triage, investigation, or remediation.|
|closedDateTime|DateTimeOffset|Time at which the alert was closed. The Timestamp type represents date and time information using ISO 8601 format and is always in UTC time. For example, midnight UTC on Jan 1, 2014 is `2014-01-01T00:00:00Z`.|
|comments|String collection|Analyst comments on the alert (for customer alert management). This method can update the **comments** field with the following values only: `Closed in IPC`, `Closed in MCAS`.|
|feedback|alertFeedback enum|Analyst feedback on the alert. Possible values are: `unknown`, `truePositive`, `falsePositive`, `benignPositive`.|
|status|alertStatus enum|Alert life cycle status (stage). Possible values are: `unknown`, `newAlert`, `inProgress`, `resolved`.|
|tags|String collection|User-definable labels that can be applied to an alert and can serve as filter conditions (for example, "HVA", "SAW").|
|vendorInformation |[securityVendorInformation](../resources/securityvendorinformation.md)|Complex type that contains details about the security product/service vendor, provider, and subprovider (for example, `vendor=Microsoft`; `provider=Windows Defender ATP`; `subProvider=AppLocker`). **Provider and vendor fields are required.**|

## Response

If successful, this method returns a `204 No Content` response code.

If the optional request header is used, the method returns a `200 OK` response code and an updated [alert](../resources/alert.md) object in the response body.

## Examples

### Example 1: Request without Prefer header

#### Request

The following is an example of the request without the `Prefer` header.

# [HTTP](#tab/http)
<!-- {
  "blockType": "request",
  "name": "update_alert_1"
}-->

```http
PATCH https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/security/alerts/{alert_id}
Content-type: application/json

{
  "assignedTo": "String",
  "closedDateTime": "String (timestamp)",
  "comments": ["String"],
  "feedback": "@odata.type: microsoft.graph.alertFeedback",
  "status": "@odata.type: microsoft.graph.alertStatus",
  "tags": ["String"],
  "vendorInformation":
    {
      "provider": "String",
      "vendor": "String"
    }
}
```

# [C#](#tab/csharp)

```csharp

GraphServiceClient graphClient = new GraphServiceClient( authProvider );

var alert = new Alert
{
	AssignedTo = "String",
	ClosedDateTime = DateTimeOffset.Parse("String (timestamp)"),
	Comments = new List<String>()
	{
		"String"
	},
	Feedback = AlertFeedback.Unknown,
	Status = AlertStatus.Unknown,
	Tags = new List<String>()
	{
		"String"
	},
	VendorInformation = new SecurityVendorInformation
	{
		Provider = "String",
		Vendor = "String"
	}
};

await graphClient.Security.Alerts["{alert-id}"]
	.Request()
	.UpdateAsync(alert);

```


 [!IMPORTANT]
 Microsoft Graph SDKs use the v1.0 version of the API by default, and do not support all the types, properties, and APIs available in the beta version. For details about accessing the beta API with the SDK, see [Use the Microsoft Graph SDKs with the beta API](/graph/sdks/use-beta).

 For details about how to [add the SDK](/graph/sdks/sdk-installation) to your project and [create an authProvider](/graph/sdks/choose-authentication-providers) instance, see the [SDK documentation](/graph/sdks/sdks-overview).

#### Response

The following is an example of a successful response.
<!-- {
  "blockType": "response"
} -->

```http
HTTP/1.1 204 No Content
```

### Example 2: Request with Prefer header

#### Request

The following example shows a request that includes the `Prefer` request header.


# [HTTP](#tab/http)
<!-- {
  "blockType": "request",
  "name": "update_alert_2"
}-->

```http
PATCH https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/security/alerts/{alert_id}

  "feedback": "@odata.type: microsoft.graph.alertFeedback",
  "status": "@odata.type: microsoft.graph.alertStatus",
  "tags": ["String"],

    {
      "provider": "String",
      "vendor": "String"
    }
}
```

# [C#](#tab/csharp)

```csharp

GraphServiceClient graphClient = new GraphServiceClient( authProvider );

var alert = new Alert
{
	AssignedTo = "String",
	ClosedDateTime = DateTimeOffset.Parse("String (timestamp)"),
	Comments = new List<String>()
	{
		"String"
	},
	Feedback = AlertFeedback.Unknown,
	Status = AlertStatus.Unknown,
	Tags = new List<String>()
	{
		"String"
	},
	VendorInformation = new SecurityVendorInformation
	{
		Provider = "String",
		Vendor = "String"

};

await graphClient.Security.Alerts["{alert-id}"]
	.Request()
	.Header("Prefer","return=representation")
	.UpdateAsync(alert);
