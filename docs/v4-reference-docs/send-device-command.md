## Examples

### Example 1: Launch URI

The following is an example of a LaunchURI request; it will launch a URI or an application on the target device. To launch a URI or an app, issue a POST using the ID of the device (obtained from doing a GET call on `me/devices`). Set the *Type* parameters to *LaunchURI* and provide a URI value such as https://bing.com.

```http

POST me/devices/{id}/commands
Authorization: Bearer Eaeou....
Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8

{ "type" : "LaunchUri", "payload" : {"uri":"https://bing.com"}}

```

}

```


### Example 2: App service

The following example shows how to query an app service on a device. To use an app service, you must do a POST call using the ID of the device (obtained from doing a GET call on `me/devices`). To use the following example, you must install the [Rome app](https://aka.ms/romanapp) on your target device.

Several additional properties must be set in the call. *Type* must be set to *AppService*, *AppServiceName* must be set to the name of the app service defined in the application, *PackageFamilyName* must be set to the package family name defined in the app manifest, and *Payload* holds the keys and values for the service you are calling within the target application.
