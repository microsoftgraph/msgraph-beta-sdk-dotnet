# Get bitlockerRecoveryKey
Namespace: microsoft.graph

> [!IMPORTANT]
> APIs under the `/beta` version in Microsoft Graph are subject to change. Use of these APIs in production applications is not supported. To determine whether an API is available in v1.0, use the **Version** selector.

Retrieve the properties and relationships of a [bitlockerRecoveryKey](../resources/bitlockerrecoverykey.md) object. 

By default, this operation does not return the **key** property that represents the actual recovery key. To include the **key** property in the response, use the `$select` OData query parameter. Including the `$select` query parameter triggers an Azure AD audit of the operation and generates an audit log. You can find the log in [Azure AD audit logs](/azure/active-directory/reports-monitoring/concept-audit-logs) under the KeyManagement category.

## Permissions
One of the following permissions is required to call this API. To learn more, including how to choose permissions, see [Permissions](/graph/permissions-reference).

|Permission type|Permissions (from least to most privileged)|
|:---|:---|
|Delegated (work or school account)|BitLockerKey.ReadBasic.All, BitLockerKey.Read.All|
|Delegated (personal Microsoft account)|Not supported.|
|Application|Not supported.|

>**Note:** For delegated permissions to allow apps to get **bitLockerRecoveryKey** resources on behalf of the signed-in user, the tenant administrator must have assigned the user one of the following roles, or the user must be the **registered owner** of the device that the BitLocker key was originally backed up from: 
* Global administrator
