# List messages

Namespace: microsoft.graph

> [!IMPORTANT]
> APIs under the `/beta` version in Microsoft Graph are subject to change. Use of these APIs in production applications is not supported. To determine whether an API is available in v1.0, use the **Version** selector.

Get the messages in the signed-in user's mailbox (including the Deleted Items and Clutter folders). 

Depending on the page size and mailbox data, getting messages from a mailbox can incur multiple requests. The default page size is 10 messages. Use `$top` to customize the page size, within the range of 1 and 1000.

To improve the operation response time, use `$select` to specify the exact properties you need; see [example 1](#example-1-list-all-messages) below. Fine-tune the values for `$select` and `$top`, especially when you must use a larger page size, as returning a page with hundreds of messages each with a full response payload may trigger the [gateway timeout](/graph/errors#http-status-codes) (HTTP 504).

To get the next page of messages, simply apply the entire URL returned in `@odata.nextLink` to the next get-messages request. This URL includes any query parameters you may have specified in the initial request. 

Do not try to extract the `$skip` value from the `@odata.nextLink` URL to manipulate responses. This API uses the `$skip` value to keep count of all the items it has gone through in the user's mailbox to return a page of message-type items. It's therefore possible that even in the initial response, the `$skip` value is larger than the page size. For more information, see [Paging Microsoft Graph data in your app](/graph/paging).

You can filter on the messages and get only those that include a [mention](../resources/mention.md) of the signed-in user. See an [example](#request-2) below. 
By default, the `GET /me/messages` operation does not return the **mentions** property. Use the `$expand` query parameter 
to [find details of each mention in a message](../api/message-get.md#example-2-get-all-mentions-in-a-specific-message).

There are two scenarios where an app can get messages in another user's mail folder:

* If the app has application permissions, or,
* If the app has the appropriate delegated [permissions](#permissions) from one user, and another user has shared a mail folder with that user, or, has given delegated access to that user. See [details and an example](/graph/outlook-share-messages-folders).

> **Note** Be aware of the [known issue](/graph/known-issues#get-messages-returns-chats-in-microsoft-teams) that this operation includes Microsoft Teams chat messages in its response.
 
## Permissions
One of the following permissions is required to call this API. To learn more, including how to choose permissions, see [Permissions](/graph/permissions-reference).

|Permission type      | Permissions (from least to most privileged)              |
|:--------------------|:---------------------------------------------------------|
|Delegated (work or school account) | Mail.ReadBasic, Mail.Read, Mail.ReadWrite    |
|Delegated (personal Microsoft account) | Mail.ReadBasic, Mail.Read, Mail.ReadWrite    |
|Application | Mail.ReadBasic.All, Mail.Read, Mail.ReadWrite |

## HTTP request

To get all the messages in a user's mailbox:

<!-- { "blockType": "ignored" } -->
```http
GET /me/messages
GET /users/{id | userPrincipalName}/messages
```

To get messages in a specific folder in the user's mailbox:

<!-- { "blockType": "ignored" } -->
```http
GET /me/mailFolders/{id}/messages
GET /users/{id | userPrincipalName}/mailFolders/{id}/messages
```

To get all the messages in the user's mailbox that include a **mention** of the user:

<!-- { "blockType": "ignored" } -->
```http
GET /me/messages?$filter=mentionsPreview/isMentioned eq true
GET /users/{id | userPrincipalName}/messages?$filter=mentionsPreview/isMentioned eq true
```

## Optional query parameters
This method supports the [OData Query Parameters](/graph/query-parameters) to help customize the response.

You can use the `$filter` query parameter on the **mentionsPreview** property to get those messages that mention the signed-in user.

### Using filter and orderby in the same query
When using `$filter` and `$orderby` in the same query to get messages, make sure to specify properties in the following ways:

1. Properties that appear in `$orderby` must also appear in `$filter`. 
2. Properties that appear in `$orderby` are in the same order as in `$filter`.
3. Properties that are present in `$orderby` appear in `$filter` before any properties that aren't.

Failing to do this results in the following error:

- Error code: `InefficientFilter`
- Error message: `The restriction or sort order is too complex for this operation.`

## Request headers
| Name       | Type | Description|
|:-----------|:------|:----------|
| Authorization  | string  | Bearer {token}. Required. |
| Prefer: outlook.body-content-type | string | The format of the **body** and **uniqueBody** properties to be returned in. Values can be "text" or "html". If the header is not specified, the **body** and **uniqueBody** properties are returned in HTML format. Optional. |

## Request body
Do not supply a request body for this method.

## Response

If successful, this method returns a `200 OK` response code and collection of [message](../resources/message.md) objects in the response body.

## Examples
### Example 1: List all messages
#### Request
The first example gets the default, top 10 messages in the signed-in user's mailbox. It uses `$select` to return a subset of the properties of each message in the response. 

# [HTTP](#tab/http)
<!-- {
  "blockType": "request",
  "name": "get_messages"
}-->
```msgraph-interactive
GET https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/me/messages?$select=sender,subject
```

# [C#](#tab/csharp)

```csharp

GraphServiceClient graphClient = new GraphServiceClient( authProvider );

var messages = await graphClient.Me.Messages
	.Request()
	.Select("sender,subject")
	.GetAsync();

```


 [!IMPORTANT]
 Microsoft Graph SDKs use the v1.0 version of the API by default, and do not support all the types, properties, and APIs available in the beta version. For details about accessing the beta API with the SDK, see [Use the Microsoft Graph SDKs with the beta API](/graph/sdks/use-beta).

 For details about how to [add the SDK](/graph/sdks/sdk-installation) to your project and [create an authProvider](/graph/sdks/choose-authentication-providers) instance, see the [SDK documentation](/graph/sdks/sdks-overview).

#### Response
The following is an example of the response. To get the next page of messages, apply the URL returned in `@odata.nextLink` to a subsequent GET request.

<!-- {
  "blockType": "response",
  "truncated": true,
  "@odata.type": "microsoft.graph.message",
  "isCollection": true
} -->
```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-type: application/json

{
  "@odata.context": "https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/$metadata#users('bb8775a4-4d8c-42cf-a1d4-4d58c2bb668f')/messages(sender,subject)",
  "value": [
    {
      "@odata.etag": "W/\"CQAAABYAAADHcgC8Hl9tRZ/hc1wEUs1TAAAwR4Hg\"",
      "id": "AAMkAGUAAAwTW09AAA=",
      "subject": "You have late tasks!",
      "sender": {
        "emailAddress": {
          "name": "Microsoft Planner",
          "address": "noreply@Planner.Office365.com"
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

### Example 2: Use $filter to get all messages satisfying a specific condition
#### Request
The next example filters all messages in the signed-in user's mailbox for those that mention the user. It also uses `$select` to return a subset of the properties of each message in the response. 

The following example also incorporates URL encoding for the space characters in the query parameter string.

# [HTTP](#tab/http)
<!-- {
  "blockType": "request",
  "name": "get_messages_with_mentions"
}-->
```msgraph-interactive
GET https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/me/messages?$filter=MentionsPreview/IsMentioned%20eq%20true&$select=Subject,Sender,ReceivedDateTime,MentionsPreview
```

# [C#](#tab/csharp)

```csharp

GraphServiceClient graphClient = new GraphServiceClient( authProvider );

var messages = await graphClient.Me.Messages
	.Request()
	.Filter("MentionsPreview/IsMentioned eq true")
	.Select("subject,sender,receivedDateTime,mentionsPreview")
	.GetAsync();

```

### Example 3: Use prefer header to get the message body and uniqueBody is text format
#### Request
The third example shows how to use a `Prefer: outlook.body-content-type="text"` header to get the **body** and **uniqueBody** properties of each message in text format.

# [HTTP](#tab/http)
<!-- {
  "blockType": "request",
  "name": "get_messages_in_text"
}-->
```msgraph-interactive
GET https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/me/messages?$select=subject,body,bodyPreview,uniqueBody
Prefer: outlook.body-content-type="text"
```

# [C#](#tab/csharp)

```csharp

GraphServiceClient graphClient = new GraphServiceClient( authProvider );

var messages = await graphClient.Me.Messages
	.Request()
	.Header("Prefer","outlook.body-content-type=\"text\"")
	.Select("subject,body,bodyPreview,uniqueBody")
	.GetAsync();

```
