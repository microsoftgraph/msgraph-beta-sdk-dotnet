# Add app to chat

Namespace: microsoft.graph

> [!IMPORTANT]
> APIs under the `/beta` version in Microsoft Graph are subject to change. Use of these APIs in production applications is not supported. To determine whether an API is available in v1.0, use the **Version** selector.

Install a [teamsApp](../resources/teamsapp.md) to the specified [chat](../resources/chat.md).

> **Notes**:
> - If the chat is associated with an [onlineMeeting](../resources/onlinemeeting.md) instance, then, effectively, the **teamsApp** will get installed to the meeting.
> - Currently, this operation does not support installation of apps that require resource-specific consent permissions. For details, see [Known issues](/graph/known-issues#Installation-of-apps-that-require-resource-specific-consent-permissions-is-not-supported).

One of the following permissions is required to call this API. To learn more, including how to choose permissions, see [Permissions](/graph/permissions-reference).

|Delegated (personal Microsoft account) | Not supported.    |

 [!IMPORTANT]
 Microsoft Graph SDKs use the v1.0 version of the API by default, and do not support all the types, properties, and APIs available in the beta version. For details about accessing the beta API with the SDK, see [Use the Microsoft Graph SDKs with the beta API](/graph/sdks/use-beta).

 For details about how to [add the SDK](/graph/sdks/sdk-installation) to your project and [create an authProvider](/graph/sdks/choose-authentication-providers) instance, see the [SDK documentation](/graph/sdks/sdks-overview).
