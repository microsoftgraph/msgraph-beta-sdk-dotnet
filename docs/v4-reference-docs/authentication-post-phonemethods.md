# Create phoneAuthenticationMethod

Namespace: microsoft.graph

> [!IMPORTANT]
> APIs under the `/beta` version in Microsoft Graph are subject to change. Use of these APIs in production applications is not supported. To determine whether an API is available in v1.0, use the **Version** selector.

Add a new [phone authentication method](../resources/phoneauthenticationmethod.md). A user may only have one phone of each type, captured in the **phoneType** property. This means, for example, adding a `mobile` phone to a user with a preexisting `mobile` phone will fail. Additionally, a user must always have a `mobile` phone before adding an `alternateMobile` phone.

Adding a phone number makes it available for use in both Azure multi-factor authentication (MFA) and self-service password reset (SSPR), if enabled.

Additionally, if a user is enabled by policy to use SMS sign-in and a `mobile` number is added, the system will attempt to register the number for use in that system.

## Permissions

One of the following permissions is required to call this API. To learn more, including how to choose permissions, see [Permissions](/graph/permissions-reference).

### Permissions acting on self

|Permission type      | Permissions (from least to most privileged)              |
|:---------------------------------------|:-------------------------|
| Delegated (work or school account)     | UserAuthenticationMethod.ReadWrite |
| Delegated (personal Microsoft account) | Not supported. |
| Application                            | Not supported. |

### Permissions acting on other users

|Permission type      | Permissions (from least to most privileged)              |
|:---------------------------------------|:-------------------------|
| Delegated (work or school account)     | UserAuthenticationMethod.ReadWrite.All |
| Delegated (personal Microsoft account) | Not supported. |
| Application                            | UserAuthenticationMethod.ReadWrite.All |

For delegated scenarios where an admin is acting on another user, the admin needs one of the following [Azure AD roles](/azure/active-directory/users-groups-roles/directory-assign-admin-roles#available-roles):

* Global administrator
* Privileged authentication administrator
* Authentication administrator

## HTTP request

<!-- { "blockType": "ignored" } -->

```http
POST /me/authentication/phoneMethods
POST /users/{id | userPrincipalName}/authentication/phoneMethods
```

## Request headers

| Name          | Description   |
|:--------------|:--------------|
| Authorization | Bearer {token}. Required. |
| Content-Type  | application/json. Required. |

## Request body

In the request body, supply a JSON representation of a [phoneAuthenticationMethod](../resources/phoneauthenticationmethod.md) object. The JSON must include `phoneNumber` and `phoneType`, but not `smsSignInState` (which is read-only).

| Property     | Type        | Description |
|:-------------|:------------|:------------|
|phoneNumber|String|The phone number to text or call for authentication. Phone numbers use the format "+\<country code\> \<number\>x\<extension\>", with extension optional. For example, +1 5555551234 or +1 5555551234x123 are valid. Numbers are rejected when creating/updating if they do not match the required format.|
|phoneType|String|Possible values are: `mobile`, `alternateMobile`, and `office`.|

## Response

If successful, this method returns a `201 Created` response code and a new [phoneAuthenticationMethod](../resources/phoneauthenticationmethod.md) object in the response body.

## Examples

 [!IMPORTANT]
 Microsoft Graph SDKs use the v1.0 version of the API by default, and do not support all the types, properties, and APIs available in the beta version. For details about accessing the beta API with the SDK, see [Use the Microsoft Graph SDKs with the beta API](/graph/sdks/use-beta).

 For details about how to [add the SDK](/graph/sdks/sdk-installation) to your project and [create an authProvider](/graph/sdks/choose-authentication-providers) instance, see the [SDK documentation](/graph/sdks/sdks-overview).
