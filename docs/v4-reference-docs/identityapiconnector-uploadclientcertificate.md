# identityApiConnector: uploadClientCertificate

Namespace: microsoft.graph

> [!IMPORTANT]
> APIs under the `/beta` version in Microsoft Graph are subject to change. Use of these APIs in production applications is not supported. To determine whether an API is available in v1.0, use the **Version** selector.

Upload a PKCS 12 format key (.pfx) to an API connector's authentication configuration. The input is a base-64 encoded value of the PKCS 12 certificate contents. This method returns an [apiConnector](../resources/identityApiConnector.md).

## Permissions

One of the following permissions is required to call this API. To learn more, including how to choose permissions, see [Permissions](/graph/permissions-reference).

| Permission type                        | Permissions (from least to most privileged) |
| :------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------ |
| Delegated (work or school account)     | APIConnectors.ReadWrite.All |
| Delegated (personal Microsoft account) | Not supported.  |
| Application                            | APIConnectors.ReadWrite.All |

The work or school account needs to belong to one of the following roles:

* Global administrator
* External Identity User Flow administrator

## HTTP request

<!-- { "blockType": "ignored" } -->

```http
POST /identity/apiconnectors/{id}/uploadClientCertificate
```

## Request headers

| Name          | Description   |
|:--------------|:--------------|
| Authorization | Bearer {token}. Required. |
| Content-type  | application/json. Required. |

## Request body

In the request body, provide a JSON object with the following parameters.

|Property|Type|Description|
|:---|:---|:---|
|pkcs12Value|String| This is the field for sending the pfx content. The value should be a base-64 encoded version of the actual certificate content. Required.|
|password|String| This is the password for the pfx file. Required. If no password is used, must still provide a value of `""`.|

## Response

If successful, this method returns a `200 OK` response code and the [apiConnector](../resources/identityApiConnector.md) whose `authenticationConfiguration` contains the public information of the client certificate.

## Examples

### Request

The following is an example of the request.


# [HTTP](#tab/http)
<!-- {
  "blockType": "request",
  "name": "identityapiconnector_uploadclientcertificate"
}-->

```http
POST https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/identity/apiconnectors/{id}/uploadClientCertificate
Content-type: application/json

{
    "pkcs12Value": "eyJhbGciOiJSU0EtT0FFUCIsImVuYyI6IkEyNTZHQ00ifQ...kDJ04sJShkkgjL9Bm49plA",
    "password": "<password>"
}
```

# [C#](#tab/csharp)

```csharp

GraphServiceClient graphClient = new GraphServiceClient( authProvider );

var pkcs12Value = "eyJhbGciOiJSU0EtT0FFUCIsImVuYyI6IkEyNTZHQ00ifQ...kDJ04sJShkkgjL9Bm49plA";

var password = "<password>";

await graphClient.Identity.ApiConnectors["{identityApiConnector-id}"]
	.UploadClientCertificate(pkcs12Value,password)
	.Request()
	.PostAsync();

```


 [!IMPORTANT]
 Microsoft Graph SDKs use the v1.0 version of the API by default, and do not support all the types, properties, and APIs available in the beta version. For details about accessing the beta API with the SDK, see [Use the Microsoft Graph SDKs with the beta API](/graph/sdks/use-beta).

 For details about how to [add the SDK](/graph/sdks/sdk-installation) to your project and [create an authProvider](/graph/sdks/choose-authentication-providers) instance, see the [SDK documentation](/graph/sdks/sdks-overview).

### Response

The following is an example of the response.

> **Note:** `authenticationConfiguration` in the response is of type [microsoft.graph.clientCertificateAuthentication](../resources/clientcertificateauthentication.md) because this represents the public information of uploaded certificates.
