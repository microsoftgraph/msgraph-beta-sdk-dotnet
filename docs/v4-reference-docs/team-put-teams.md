# Create team from group

Namespace: microsoft.graph

> [!IMPORTANT]
> APIs under the `/beta` version in Microsoft Graph are subject to change. Use of these APIs in production applications is not supported. To determine whether an API is available in v1.0, use the **Version** selector.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This API is in the process of being deprecated in favor of [Create team](../api/team-post.md), and will be removed by the end of 2019. For details about how to create a team from a group, see examples 4 and 5 in [Create team](../api/team-post.md).

Create a new [team](../resources/team.md) from a [group](../resources/group.md).

In order to create a team, the group must have a least one owner.

If the group was created less than 15 minutes ago, it's possible for the Create team call to fail with a 404 error code due to replication delays.
The recommended pattern is to retry the Create team call three times, with a 10 second delay between calls.

## Permissions

One of the following permissions is required to call this API. To learn more, including how to choose permissions, see [Permissions](/graph/permissions-reference).

|Permission type      | Permissions (from least to most privileged)              |
|:--------------------|:---------------------------------------------------------|
|Delegated (work or school account) | Group.ReadWrite.All, Directory.ReadWrite.All |
|Delegated (personal Microsoft account) | Not supported.    |
|Application | Group.ReadWrite.All, Directory.ReadWrite.All |

> **Note**: This API supports admin permissions. Global admins and Microsoft Teams service admins can access groups that they are not a member of.

 [!IMPORTANT]
 Microsoft Graph SDKs use the v1.0 version of the API by default, and do not support all the types, properties, and APIs available in the beta version. For details about accessing the beta API with the SDK, see [Use the Microsoft Graph SDKs with the beta API](/graph/sdks/use-beta).

 For details about how to [add the SDK](/graph/sdks/sdk-installation) to your project and [create an authProvider](/graph/sdks/choose-authentication-providers) instance, see the [SDK documentation](/graph/sdks/sdks-overview).
