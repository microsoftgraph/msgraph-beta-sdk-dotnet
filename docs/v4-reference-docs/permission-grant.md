# permission: grant

Namespace: microsoft.graph

> [!IMPORTANT]
> APIs under the `/beta` version in Microsoft Graph are subject to change. Use of these APIs in production applications is not supported. To determine whether an API is available in v1.0, use the **Version** selector.

Grant users access to a link represented by a [permission][].

## Permissions

One of the following permissions is required to call this API. To learn more, including how to choose permissions, see [Permissions](/graph/permissions-reference).

| Permission type                   | Permissions (from least to most privileged)              |
|:----------------------------------|:---------------------------------------------------------|
|Delegated (work or school account) | Files.ReadWrite, Files.ReadWrite.All, Sites.ReadWrite.All    |
|Delegated (personal Microsoft account) | Not supported    |
|Application | Files.ReadWrite.All, Sites.ReadWrite.All |

## HTTP request

<!-- { "blockType": "ignored" } -->

```http
POST /shares/{encoded-sharing-url}/permission/grant
```

## Request headers

| Name          | Description  |
|:------------- |:------------ |
| Authorization | Bearer \{token\}. Required. |

## Request body

In the request body, provide a JSON object with the following parameters.

<!-- { "blockType": "ignored", "scopes": "files.readwrite" } -->

```json
{
  "recipients": [
    { "@odata.type": "microsoft.graph.driveRecipient" }
  ],
  "roles": [ "read | write"]
}
```

| Parameter          | Type                           | Description
|:-------------------|:-------------------------------|:-------------------------
| recipients         | Collection([driveRecipient][]) | A collection of recipients who will receive access.
| roles              | Collection(String)             | If the link is an "existing access" link, specifies roles to be granted to the users. Otherwise must match the role of the link.

For a list of available roles, see [roles property values](../resources/permission.md#roles-property-values).

## Response

If successful, this method returns a `200 OK` response code and a [permission][] collection in the response body.

A [permission][] representing the updated link will always be returned in the result set on success. The updated link can be identified by the presence of a 'link' facet containing the 'scope' property. In some cases it may be possible that the updated link has a different URL than the original link, in which case the new URL should be used.

Read the [Error Responses][error-response] topic for more info about how errors are returned.


## Example

This example grants the users john@contoso.com and ryan@external.com access to a sharing link without modifying other existing permissions on the link.

### Request


# [HTTP](#tab/http)
<!-- { "blockType": "request", "name": "permission-grant", "scopes": "files.readwrite", "target": "action" } -->

```http
POST https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/shares/{encoded-sharing-url}/permission/grant
Content-type: application/json

{
  "recipients": [
    {
      "email": "john@contoso.com"
    },
    {
      "email": "ryan@external.com"
    }
  ],
  "roles": ["read"]
}
```

# [C#](#tab/csharp)

```csharp

GraphServiceClient graphClient = new GraphServiceClient( authProvider );

var recipients = new List<DriveRecipient>()
{
	new DriveRecipient
	{
		Email = "john@contoso.com"
	},
	new DriveRecipient
	{
		Email = "ryan@external.com"
	}
};

var roles = new List<String>()
{
	"read"
};

await graphClient.Shares["{sharedDriveItem-id}"].Permission
	.Grant(roles,recipients)
	.Request()
	.PostAsync();

```


 [!IMPORTANT]
 Microsoft Graph SDKs use the v1.0 version of the API by default, and do not support all the types, properties, and APIs available in the beta version. For details about accessing the beta API with the SDK, see [Use the Microsoft Graph SDKs with the beta API](/graph/sdks/use-beta).

 For details about how to [add the SDK](/graph/sdks/sdk-installation) to your project and [create an authProvider](/graph/sdks/choose-authentication-providers) instance, see the [SDK documentation](/graph/sdks/sdks-overview).

### Response

<!-- { "blockType": "response", "@odata.type": "Collection(microsoft.graph.permission)", "truncated": true } -->

```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-type: application/json

{
  "value": [
    {
      "hasPassword": false,
      "id": "5fab944a-47ec-48d0-a9b5-5178a926d00f",
      "link": {
        "preventsDownload": false,
        "scope": "users",
        "type": "view",
        "webUrl": "https://contoso.sharepoint.com/:t:/g/design/EZexPoDjW4dMtKFUfAl6BK4BvIUuss52hLYzihBfx-PD6Q"
      },
      "roles": [
        "read"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

>**Note:** The response object shown here might be shortened for readability.

If the link is an [existing access](../resources/permission.md#existing-access-link) link, additional permissions will be returned representing the following:

- User-type permissions representing recipients who were successfully granted access. These can be identified by presence of the **grantedTo** property.
- Link-type permissions representing invitations that need to be sent to unrecognized external users for them to gain access. These can be identified by the presence of an [invitation](../resources/sharinginvitation.md) facet. These entries will contain a [link][sharing-link] with the invitation URL, and the grantedToIdentities collection will indicate the users to whom the link should be sent.
