> APIs under the `/beta` version in Microsoft Graph are subject to change. Use of these APIs in production applications is not supported. To determine whether an API is available in v1.0, use the **Version** selector.

Create a [connectorGroup](../resources/connectorgroup.md) object.

## Permissions
One of the following permissions is required to call this API. To learn more, including how to choose permissions, see [Permissions](/graph/permissions-reference).

|Permission type      | Permissions (from least to most privileged)              |
|:--------------------|:---------------------------------------------------------|
|Delegated (work or school account) | Directory.ReadWrite.All    |
|Delegated (personal Microsoft account) | Not supported.    |
|Application | Not supported.  |

## HTTP request
<!-- { "blockType": "ignored" } -->
```http

```

## Optional request headers
| Name       | Description|
|:-----------|:-----------|
| Authorization  | Bearer. Required.|
| Content-type | application/json. Required. |

## Request body
In the request body, supply a JSON representation of a [connectorGroup](../resources/connectorgroup.md) object.
The following table lists the properties available for a **connectorGroup**. The **name** property is a required property.

| Property	   | Type	|Description|
|:---------------|:--------|:----------|
|connectorGroupType|string| Indicates the type of hybrid agent. This property is preset by the system.|
|id|string| Unique identifier for this connectorGroup. Read-only. |

|name|string| The name associated with the connectorGroup. |
|region|string| The region the connectorGroup is assigned to and will optimize traffic for. This region can only be set if **no** connectors or applications are assigned to the connectorGroup.

## Response

If successful, this method returns a `201 Created` response code and a [connectorGroup](../resources/connectorgroup.md) object in the response body.
## Example
### Request
The following is an example of the request.

# [HTTP](#tab/http)
<!-- {
  "blockType": "request",
  "name": "update_connectorgroup_1"

```http
POST https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/onPremisesPublishingProfiles/applicationProxy/connectorGroups
Content-type: application/json

{
  "name": "Connector Group Demo"

}
```

# [C#](#tab/csharp)

```csharp

GraphServiceClient graphClient = new GraphServiceClient( authProvider );

var connectorGroup = new ConnectorGroup
{

```


 [!IMPORTANT]
 Microsoft Graph SDKs use the v1.0 version of the API by default, and do not support all the types, properties, and APIs available in the beta version. For details about accessing the beta API with the SDK, see [Use the Microsoft Graph SDKs with the beta API](/graph/sdks/use-beta).

 For details about how to [add the SDK](/graph/sdks/sdk-installation) to your project and [create an authProvider](/graph/sdks/choose-authentication-providers) instance, see the [SDK documentation](/graph/sdks/sdks-overview).
