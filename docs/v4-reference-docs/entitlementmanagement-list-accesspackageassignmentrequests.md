# List accessPackageAssignmentRequests

Namespace: microsoft.graph

> [!IMPORTANT]
> APIs under the `/beta` version in Microsoft Graph are subject to change. Use of these APIs in production applications is not supported. To determine whether an API is available in v1.0, use the **Version** selector.

In [Azure AD entitlement management](../resources/entitlementmanagement-overview.md), retrieve a list of [accessPackageAssignmentRequest](../resources/accesspackageassignmentrequest.md) objects.  The resulting list includes all the assignment requests, current and well as expired, that the caller has access to read, across all catalogs and access packages.

## Permissions

One of the following permissions is required to call this API. To learn more, including how to choose permissions, see [Permissions](/graph/permissions-reference).

| Permission type                        | Permissions (from least to most privileged) |
|:---------------------------------------|:--------------------------------------------|
| Delegated (work or school account)     | EntitlementManagement.Read.All, EntitlementManagement.ReadWrite.All |
| Delegated (personal Microsoft account) | Not supported. |
| Application                            | EntitlementManagement.Read.All, EntitlementManagement.ReadWrite.All |

## HTTP request

<!-- { "blockType": "ignored" } -->

```http
GET /identityGovernance/entitlementManagement/accessPackageAssignmentRequests
```

## Query parameters

This method supports the `$select`, `$expand` and `$filter` OData query parameters to help customize the response.

If the user or application only has permissions within a specific catalog or catalogs, you must include in the query a filter which specifies an access package, such as `$expand=accessPackage&$filter=accessPackage/id eq '9bbe5f7d-f1e7-4eb1-a586-38cdf6f8b1ea'`.

### Example scenarios for using query parameters

- To retrieve the access package of each request, include `$expand=accessPackage` in the query. 
- To retrieve the resulting assignment, include `$expand=accessPackageAssignment` in the query. 
- To obtain more details on the requestor, include `$expand=requestor` in the query.

For general information, see [OData query parameters](/graph/query-parameters).

## Request headers

| Name      |Description|
|:----------|:----------|
| Authorization | Bearer \{token\}. Required. |

## Request body

Do not supply a request body for this method.

## Response

If successful, this method returns a `200 OK` response code and a collection of [accessPackageAssignmentRequest](../resources/accesspackageassignmentrequest.md) objects in the response body.

## Examples

### Request

The following is an example of the request. The request URI includes `$filter` to only return requests in a particular state, and `$expand` to return details of the requestor and their connected organization as well.

# [HTTP](#tab/http)
<!-- {
  "blockType": "request",
  "name": "get_accesspackageassignmentrequests"
}-->

```msgraph-interactive
GET https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/identityGovernance/entitlementManagement/accessPackageAssignmentRequests?$expand=requestor($expand=connectedOrganization)&$filter=(requestState eq 'PendingApproval')
```

# [C#](#tab/csharp)

```csharp

GraphServiceClient graphClient = new GraphServiceClient( authProvider );

var accessPackageAssignmentRequests = await graphClient.IdentityGovernance.EntitlementManagement.AccessPackageAssignmentRequests
	.Request()
	.Filter("(requestState eq 'PendingApproval')")
	.Expand("requestor($expand=connectedOrganization)")
	.GetAsync();

```


 [!IMPORTANT]
 Microsoft Graph SDKs use the v1.0 version of the API by default, and do not support all the types, properties, and APIs available in the beta version. For details about accessing the beta API with the SDK, see [Use the Microsoft Graph SDKs with the beta API](/graph/sdks/use-beta).

 For details about how to [add the SDK](/graph/sdks/sdk-installation) to your project and [create an authProvider](/graph/sdks/choose-authentication-providers) instance, see the [SDK documentation](/graph/sdks/sdks-overview).

### Response

The following is an example of the response.
