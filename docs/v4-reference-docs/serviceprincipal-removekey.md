Remove a key credential from a [servicePrincipal](../resources/serviceprincipal.md). This method along with [addKey](serviceprincipal-addkey.md) can be used by a servicePrincipal to automate rolling its expiring keys.

> [!NOTE]
> [Create servicePrincipal](../api/serviceprincipal-post-serviceprincipals.md) and
[Update servicePrincipal](../api/serviceprincipal-update.md) operations can continue to be used to add and update key credentials for any servicePrincipal with or without a user's context.

As part of the request validation for this method, a proof of possession of an existing key is verified before the action can be performed.
