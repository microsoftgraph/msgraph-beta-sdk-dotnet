Namespace: microsoft.graph

> [!IMPORTANT]
> APIs under the `/beta` version in Microsoft Graph are subject to change. Use of these APIs in production applications is not supported. To determine whether an API is available in v1.0, use the **Version** selector.

Return all the group IDs for the groups that the specified [user](../resources/user.md), [group](../resources/group.md), [service principal](../resources/serviceprincipal.md), [organizational contact](../resources/orgcontact.md), [device](../resources/device.md), or [directory object](../resources/directoryobject.md) is a member of. This function is transitive.
