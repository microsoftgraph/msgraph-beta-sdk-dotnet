# Get mailFolder

Namespace: microsoft.graph

> [!IMPORTANT]
> APIs under the `/beta` version in Microsoft Graph are subject to change. Use of these APIs in production applications is not supported. To determine whether an API is available in v1.0, use the **Version** selector.

Retrieve the properties and relationships of a message folder object.

The following list shows the two existing scenarios where an app can get another user's mail folder:

* If the app has application permissions, or,
* If the app has the appropriate delegated [permissions](#permissions) from one user, and another user has shared a mail folder with that user, or, has given delegated access to that user. For more details, see [Get Outlook messages in a shared or delegated folder](/graph/outlook-share-messages-folders).

## Permissions

One of the following permissions is required to call this API. To learn more, including how to choose permissions, see [Permissions](/graph/permissions-reference).

|Permission type      | Permissions (from least to most privileged)              |
|:--------------------|:---------------------------------------------------------|
|Delegated (work or school account) | Mail.ReadBasic, Mail.Read, Mail.ReadWrite    |
|Delegated (personal Microsoft account) | Mail.ReadBasic, Mail.Read, Mail.ReadWrite    |
|Application | Mail.ReadBasic.All, Mail.Read, Mail.ReadWrite |

 [!IMPORTANT]
 Microsoft Graph SDKs use the v1.0 version of the API by default, and do not support all the types, properties, and APIs available in the beta version. For details about accessing the beta API with the SDK, see [Use the Microsoft Graph SDKs with the beta API](/graph/sdks/use-beta).

 For details about how to [add the SDK](/graph/sdks/sdk-installation) to your project and [create an authProvider](/graph/sdks/choose-authentication-providers) instance, see the [SDK documentation](/graph/sdks/sdks-overview).
