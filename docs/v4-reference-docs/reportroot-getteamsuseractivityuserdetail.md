> APIs under the `/beta` version in Microsoft Graph are subject to change. Use of these APIs in production applications is not supported. To determine whether an API is available in v1.0, use the **Version** selector.

Get details about Microsoft Teams user activity by user.

## Permissions

One of the following permissions is required to call this API. To learn more, including how to choose permissions, see [Permissions](/graph/permissions-reference).

| Permission type                        | Permissions (from least to most privileged) |
| :------------------------------------- | :--------------------------------------- |
| Delegated (work or school account)     | Reports.Read.All                         |
| Delegated (personal Microsoft account) | Not supported.                           |
| Application                            | Reports.Read.All                         |

**Note**: For delegated permissions to allow apps to read service usage reports on behalf of a user, the tenant administrator must have assigned the user the appropriate Azure AD limited administrator role. For more details, see [Authorization for APIs to read Microsoft 365 usage reports](/graph/reportroot-authorization).

## HTTP request

<!-- { "blockType": "ignored" } -->

```http
GET /reports/getTeamsUserActivityUserDetail(period='{period_value}')
GET /reports/getTeamsUserActivityUserDetail(date={date_value})
```

## Function parameters

In the request URL, provide one of the following parameters with a valid value.

| Parameter | Type   | Description                              |
| :-------- | :----- | :--------------------------------------- |
| period    | string | Specifies the length of time over which the report is aggregated. The supported values for {period_value} are: D7, D30, D90, and D180. These values follow the format D*n* where *n* represents the number of days over which the report is aggregated. |
| date      | Date   | Specifies the date for which you would like to view the users who performed any activity. {date_value} must have a format of YYYY-MM-DD. As this report is only available for the past 30 days, {date_value} should be a date from that range. |

> **Note:** You need to set either period or date in the URL.

## Optional query parameters

This method supports the `$format`, `$top`, and `$skipToken` [OData query parameters](/graph/query-parameters) to customize the response. The default output type is `text/csv`. However, if you want to specify the output type, you can use the OData `$format` query parameter set to `text/csv` or `application/json`.

## Request headers

| Name          | Description               |
| :------------ | :------------------------ |
| Authorization | Bearer {token}. Required. |

## Request body

Do not supply a request body for this method.

## Response

The CSV file has the following headers for columns.

- Report Refresh Date
- Tenant Display Name
- Shared Channel Tenant Display Names
- User Id
- User Principal Name
- Last Activity Date
- Is Deleted
- Deleted Date
- Assigned Products
- Team Chat Message Count
- Private Chat Message Count
- Call Count

- Scheduled Recurring Meetings Attended Count
- Audio Duration
- Video Duration
- Screen Share Duration
- Audio Duration In Seconds
- Video Duration In Seconds
- Screen Share Duration In Seconds

> [!NOTE]
> The values in the Meetings Organized Count might not be the sum of the Ad Hoc Meetings Organized Count, Scheduled One-time Meetings Organized Count, and Scheduled Recurring Meetings Organized Count that a user organized during the specified time period. This is because the Unclassified meetings value is not included in the output CSV file. For details, see [Microsoft Teams user activity report](/microsoftteams/teams-analytics-and-reports/user-activity-report).
