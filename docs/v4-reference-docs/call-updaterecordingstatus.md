# call: updateRecordingStatus

Namespace: microsoft.graph

> [!IMPORTANT]
> APIs under the `/beta` version in Microsoft Graph are subject to change. Use of these APIs in production applications is not supported. To determine whether an API is available in v1.0, use the **Version** selector.

Update the application's recording status associated with a call. This requires the use of the [Teams policy-based recording](/MicrosoftTeams/teams-recording-policy) solution.

> **Additional Restriction**: You may NOT use the Media Access API to record or otherwise persist media content from calls or meetings that your application accesses, or data derived from that media content ("record" or "recording"), without first calling the **updateRecordingStatus** API to indicate that recording has begun, and receiving a success reply from that API. If your application begins recording any meeting, it must end the recording prior to calling the **updateRecordingStatus** API to indicate that the recording has ended.

## Permissions
One of the following permissions is required to call this API. To learn more, including how to choose permissions, see [Permissions](/graph/permissions-reference).

 [!IMPORTANT]
 Microsoft Graph SDKs use the v1.0 version of the API by default, and do not support all the types, properties, and APIs available in the beta version. For details about accessing the beta API with the SDK, see [Use the Microsoft Graph SDKs with the beta API](/graph/sdks/use-beta).

 For details about how to [add the SDK](/graph/sdks/sdk-installation) to your project and [create an authProvider](/graph/sdks/choose-authentication-providers) instance, see the [SDK documentation](/graph/sdks/sdks-overview).
