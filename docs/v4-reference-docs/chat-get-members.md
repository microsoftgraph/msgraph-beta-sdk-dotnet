# Get conversationMember in a chat

Namespace: microsoft.graph

> [!IMPORTANT]
> APIs under the `/beta` version in Microsoft Graph are subject to change. Use of these APIs in production applications is not supported. To determine whether an API is available in v1.0, use the **Version** selector.

Retrieve a [conversationMember](../resources/conversationmember.md) from a [chat](../resources/chat.md).

> [!NOTE]
> The membership IDs returned by the server must be treated as opaque strings. The client should not try to parse or make any assumptions about these resource IDs.
>
> The membership results could map to users from different tenants, as indicated in the response, in the future. The client should not assume that all members are from the current tenant only.
