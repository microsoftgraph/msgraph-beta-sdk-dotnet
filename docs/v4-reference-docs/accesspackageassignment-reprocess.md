# accessPackageAssignment: reprocess

Namespace: microsoft.graph

> [!IMPORTANT]
> APIs under the `/beta` version in Microsoft Graph are subject to change. Use of these APIs in production applications is not supported. To determine whether an API is available in v1.0, use the **Version** selector.

In [Azure AD entitlement management](../resources/entitlementmanagement-overview.md), callers can automatically reevaluate and enforce an [accessPackageAssignment](../resources/accesspackageassignment.md) object of a user’s assignments for a specific access package. The **assignmentState** of the access package must be `Delivered` for the administrator to reprocess the user's assignment. Only admins with the Access Package Assignment Manager role, or higher, in Azure AD entitlement management can perform this action.

## Permissions

One of the following permissions is required to call this API. To learn more, including how to choose permissions, see [Permissions](/graph/permissions-reference).
