# Upload or replace the contents of a DriveItem

Namespace: microsoft.graph

> [!IMPORTANT]
> APIs under the `/beta` version in Microsoft Graph are subject to change. Use of these APIs in production applications is not supported. To determine whether an API is available in v1.0, use the **Version** selector.

The simple upload API allows you to provide the contents of a new file or update the contents of an existing file in a single API call. 
This method only supports files up to 4MB in size.

To upload large files see [Upload large files with an upload session](driveitem-createuploadsession.md).

## Permissions

One of the following permissions is required to call this API. To learn more, including how to choose permissions, see [Permissions](/graph/permissions-reference).

|Permission type      | Permissions (from least to most privileged)              |
|:--------------------|:---------------------------------------------------------|
|Delegated (work or school account) | Files.ReadWrite, Files.ReadWrite.All, Sites.ReadWrite.All    |
|Delegated (personal Microsoft account) | Files.ReadWrite, Files.ReadWrite.All    |
|Application | Files.ReadWrite.All, Sites.ReadWrite.All |

## HTTP request (to replace an existing item)

<!-- { "blockType": "ignored" } -->

```http
PUT /drives/{drive-id}/items/{item-id}/content
PUT /groups/{group-id}/drive/items/{item-id}/content
PUT /me/drive/items/{item-id}/content
PUT /sites/{site-id}/drive/items/{item-id}/content
PUT /users/{user-id}/drive/items/{item-id}/content
```

## HTTP request (to upload a new file)

<!-- { "blockType": "ignored" } -->

```http
PUT /drives/{drive-id}/items/{parent-id}:/{filename}:/content
PUT /groups/{group-id}/drive/items/{parent-id}:/{filename}:/content
PUT /me/drive/items/{parent-id}:/{filename}:/content
PUT /sites/{site-id}/drive/items/{parent-id}:/{filename}:/content
PUT /users/{user-id}/drive/items/{parent-id}:/{filename}:/content
```

## Request body

The contents of the request body should be the binary stream of the file to be uploaded.

## Response

If successful, this method returns a [driveItem](../resources/driveitem.md) object in the response body for the newly created or updated file.

## Example (upload a new file)

This example uploads the string "The contents of the file goes here." to a file in the signed-in user's drive under FolderA named FileB.txt.

<!-- { "blockType": "request", "name": "upload-via-put", "scopes": "files.readwrite" } -->

```http
PUT /me/drive/root:/FolderA/FileB.txt:/content
Content-Type: text/plain

The contents of the file goes here.
```

### Response

If successful, this method returns an [driveItem][item-resource] resource in the response body for the newly created or updated file.

<!-- { "blockType": "response", "@odata.type": "microsoft.graph.driveItem", "truncated": true } -->

```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "id": "0123456789abc",
  "name": "FileB.txt",
  "size": 35,
  "file": { }
}
```

## Example (updating an existing file)

This example replaces the contents of a file with a known ID.


# [HTTP](#tab/http)
<!-- { "blockType": "request", "name": "upload-via-put-id", "scopes": "files.readwrite" } -->

```http
PUT /me/drive/items/{item-id}/content
Content-Type: text/plain

The contents of the file goes here.
```

# [C#](#tab/csharp)

```csharp

GraphServiceClient graphClient = new GraphServiceClient( authProvider );

using var stream = new System.IO.MemoryStream(Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(@"The contents of the file goes here."));

await graphClient.Me.Drive.Items["{driveItem-id}"].Content
	.Request()
	.PutAsync<DriveItem>(stream);

```


 [!IMPORTANT]
 Microsoft Graph SDKs use the v1.0 version of the API by default, and do not support all the types, properties, and APIs available in the beta version. For details about accessing the beta API with the SDK, see [Use the Microsoft Graph SDKs with the beta API](/graph/sdks/use-beta).

 For details about how to [add the SDK](/graph/sdks/sdk-installation) to your project and [create an authProvider](/graph/sdks/choose-authentication-providers) instance, see the [SDK documentation](/graph/sdks/sdks-overview).

### Response

If successful, this method returns an [driveItem][item-resource] resource in the response body for the newly created file.

<!-- { "blockType": "response", "@odata.type": "microsoft.graph.driveItem", "truncated": true } -->

```http
HTTP/1.1 201 Created
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "id": "0123456789abc",
