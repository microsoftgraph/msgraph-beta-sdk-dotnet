> [!IMPORTANT]

> - To update the following properties, you must specify them in their own PATCH request, without including the other properties listed in the table above: **allowExternalSenders**, **autoSubscribeNewMembers**, **hideFromAddressLists**, **hideFromOutlookClients**, **isSubscribedByMail**, **unseenCount**.
>
> - Only a subset of the group API pertaining to core group administration and management support application and delegated permissions. All other members of the group API, including updating **autoSubscribeNewMembers**, support only delegated permissions. See [known issues](/graph/known-issues#groups) for examples.

### Manage extensions and associated data

Use this API to manage the [directory, schema, and open extensions](/graph/extensibility-overview) and their data for groups, as follows:

+ Add, update and store data in the extensions for an existing group.
+ For directory and schema extensions, remove any stored data by setting the value of the custom extension property to `null`. For open extensions, use the [Delete open extension](/graph/api/opentypeextension-delete) API.

## Response

If successful, this method returns a `204 No Content` response code—except a `200 OK` response code when updating the following properties: **allowExternalSenders**, **autoSubscribeNewMembers**, **hideFromAddressLists**, **hideFromOutlookClients**, **isSubscribedByMail**, **unseenCount**.

## Examples

  "blockType": "request",
  "name": "update_group_1"
}-->

```http
PATCH https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/groups/{id}
Content-type: application/json

{

 [!IMPORTANT]
 Microsoft Graph SDKs use the v1.0 version of the API by default, and do not support all the types, properties, and APIs available in the beta version. For details about accessing the beta API with the SDK, see [Use the Microsoft Graph SDKs with the beta API](/graph/sdks/use-beta).

 For details about how to [add the SDK](/graph/sdks/sdk-installation) to your project and [create an authProvider](/graph/sdks/choose-authentication-providers) instance, see the [SDK documentation](/graph/sdks/sdks-overview).

#### Response

The following is an example of the response.

<!-- {
  "blockType": "response"
} -->

```http
HTTP/1.1 204 No Content
```

### Example 2: Apply sensitivity label to a Microsoft 365 group

#### Request

You can obtain the ID of the label you want to apply to a Microsoft 365 group by using [List label](informationprotectionpolicy-list-labels.md). Then you can update the [assignedLabels](../resources/assignedlabel.md) property of the group with the label ID. 

>**Note:** Use of this API to apply sensitivity labels to Microsoft 365 groups is only supported for delegated permission scenarios.

# [HTTP](#tab/http)

<!-- {
  "blockType": "request",
  "name": "update_group_2"
}-->

```http
PATCH https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/groups/{id}

  [
    {
        "labelId" : "45cd0c48-c540-4358-ad79-a3658cdc5b88"
    }
  ]
}
```

# [C#](#tab/csharp)

```csharp

GraphServiceClient graphClient = new GraphServiceClient( authProvider );

var group = new Group
{
	AssignedLabels = new List<AssignedLabel>()
	{
		new AssignedLabel
		{
			LabelId = "45cd0c48-c540-4358-ad79-a3658cdc5b88"
		}
	}
};

await graphClient.Groups["{group-id}"]
