# Create federatedIdentityCredential
Namespace: microsoft.graph

> [!IMPORTANT]
> APIs under the `/beta` version in Microsoft Graph are subject to change. Use of these APIs in production applications is not supported. To determine whether an API is available in v1.0, use the **Version** selector.

Create a new [federatedIdentityCredential](../resources/federatedidentitycredential.md) object for an application. By [configuring a trust relationship](/azure/active-directory/develop/workload-identity-federation-create-trust) between your Azure AD application registration and the identity provider for your compute platform, you can use tokens issued by that platform to authenticate with Microsoft identity platform and call APIs in the Microsoft ecosystem. Maximum of 20 objects can be added to an application.

## Permissions
One of the following permissions is required to call this API. To learn more, including how to choose permissions, see [Permissions](/graph/permissions-reference).

|Permission type      | Permissions (from least to most privileged)              |
|:--------------------|:---------------------------------------------------------|
|Delegated (work or school account) | Application.ReadWrite.All    |
|Delegated (personal Microsoft account) |  Application.ReadWrite.All |
|Application | Application.ReadWrite.OwnedBy, Application.ReadWrite.All |

## HTTP request

You can address the application using either its **id** or **appId**. **id** and **appId** are referred to as the **Object ID** and **Application (Client) ID**, respectively, in the Azure portal.
<!-- { "blockType": "ignored" } -->
```http
POST /applications/{id}/federatedIdentityCredentials
POST /applications(appId='{appId}')/federatedIdentityCredentials
```

## Request headers
|Name|Description|
|:---|:---|
|Authorization|Bearer {token}. Required.|
|Content-Type|application/json. Required.|

## Request body
In the request body, supply a JSON representation of the [federatedIdentityCredential](../resources/federatedidentitycredential.md) object.

The following table shows the properties that are required when you create the [federatedIdentityCredential](../resources/federatedidentitycredential.md).

|Property|Type|Description|
|:---|:---|:---|
|audiences|String collection|The audience that can appear in the external token. This field is mandatory and should be set to `api://AzureADTokenExchange` for Azure AD. It says what Microsoft identity platform should accept in the `aud` claim in the incoming token. This value represents Azure AD in your external identity provider and has no fixed value across identity providers - you may need to create a new application registration in your identity provider to serve as the audience of this token. This field can only accept a single value and has a limit of 600 characters. Required.|
|issuer|String|TThe URL of the external identity provider and must match the issuer claim of the external token being exchanged. The combination of the values of **issuer** and **subject** must be unique on the app. It has a limit of 600 characters. Required.|
|name|String|The unique identifier for the federated identity credential, which has a limit of 120 characters and must be URL friendly. It is immutable once created|
|subject|String|Required. The identifier of the external software workload within the external identity provider. Like the audience value, it has no fixed format, as each identity provider uses their own - sometimes a GUID, sometimes a colon delimited identifier, sometimes arbitrary strings. The value here must match the sub claim within the token presented to Azure AD. It has a limit of 600 characters. The combination of **issuer** and **subject** must be unique on the app.|



## Response

If successful, this method returns a `201 Created` response code and a [federatedIdentityCredential](../resources/federatedidentitycredential.md) object in the response body.

 [!IMPORTANT]
 Microsoft Graph SDKs use the v1.0 version of the API by default, and do not support all the types, properties, and APIs available in the beta version. For details about accessing the beta API with the SDK, see [Use the Microsoft Graph SDKs with the beta API](/graph/sdks/use-beta).

 For details about how to [add the SDK](/graph/sdks/sdk-installation) to your project and [create an authProvider](/graph/sdks/choose-authentication-providers) instance, see the [SDK documentation](/graph/sdks/sdks-overview).
