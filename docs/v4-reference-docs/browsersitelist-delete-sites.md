# Delete browserSite
Namespace: microsoft.graph

> [!IMPORTANT]
> APIs under the `/beta` version in Microsoft Graph are subject to change. Use of these APIs in production applications is not supported. To determine whether an API is available in v1.0, use the **Version** selector.

Delete a [browserSite](../resources/browsersite.md) from a [browserSiteList](../resources/browsersitelist.md).

## Permissions
One of the following permissions is required to call this API. To learn more, including how to choose permissions, see [Permissions](/graph/permissions-reference).

|Permission type|Permissions (from least to most privileged)|
|:---|:---|
|Delegated (work or school account)|BrowserSiteLists.ReadWrite.All|
|Delegated (personal Microsoft account)|Not supported.|
|Application|BrowserSiteLists.ReadWrite.All|

## HTTP request

<!-- {
  "blockType": "ignored"
}
-->
``` http
DELETE /admin/edge/internetExplorerMode/siteLists/{browserSiteListId}/sites/{browserSiteId}
```

## Request headers
|Name|Description|
|:---|:---|
|Authorization|Bearer {token}. Required.|

## Request body
Do not supply a request body for this method.

## Response

If the site was not previously published, then this method returns a `204 No Content` response code on a successful delete. If the site was previously published, then this method returns a `200 OK` response code and a [browserSiteList](../resources/browsersitelist.md) object in the response body with the status as `pendingDelete`. You must publish (for example, via the [browserSiteList: publish](../api/browsersitelist-publish.md) API) the site to fully remove it from the site list.

 [!IMPORTANT]
 Microsoft Graph SDKs use the v1.0 version of the API by default, and do not support all the types, properties, and APIs available in the beta version. For details about accessing the beta API with the SDK, see [Use the Microsoft Graph SDKs with the beta API](/graph/sdks/use-beta).

 For details about how to [add the SDK](/graph/sdks/sdk-installation) to your project and [create an authProvider](/graph/sdks/choose-authentication-providers) instance, see the [SDK documentation](/graph/sdks/sdks-overview).
