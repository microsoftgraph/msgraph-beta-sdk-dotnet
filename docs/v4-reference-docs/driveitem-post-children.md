# Create a new folder in a drive

Namespace: microsoft.graph

> [!IMPORTANT]
> APIs under the `/beta` version in Microsoft Graph are subject to change. Use of these APIs in production applications is not supported. To determine whether an API is available in v1.0, use the **Version** selector.

Create a new folder or [DriveItem](../resources/driveitem.md) in a [Drive](../resources/drive.md) with a specified parent item or path.

## Permissions

One of the following permissions is required to call this API. To learn more, including how to choose permissions, see [Permissions](/graph/permissions-reference).

|Permission type      | Permissions (from least to most privileged)              |
|:--------------------|:---------------------------------------------------------|
|Delegated (work or school account) | Files.ReadWrite, Files.ReadWrite.All, Sites.ReadWrite.All    |
|Delegated (personal Microsoft account) | Files.ReadWrite, Files.ReadWrite.All    |
|Application | Files.ReadWrite.All, Sites.ReadWrite.All |

## HTTP request

<!-- { "blockType": "ignored" } -->

```http
POST /drives/{drive-id}/items/{parent-item-id}/children
POST /groups/{group-id}/drive/items/{parent-item-id}/children
POST /me/drive/items/{parent-item-id}/children
POST /sites/{site-id}/drive/items/{parent-item-id}/children
POST /users/{user-id}/drive/items/{parent-item-id}/children
```

## Request body

In the request body, supply a JSON representation of the [DriveItem](../resources/driveitem.md) resource to create.

## Response

If successful, this method returns `201 Created` response code and a [Driveitem](../resources/driveitem.md) resource in the response body.

## Example

### Request

Here is an example of the request to create a new folder in the signed-in user's OneDrive root folder.
The `@microsoft.graph.conflictBehavior` property used indicates that if an item already exists with the same name, the service should choose a new name for the folder while creating it.


# [HTTP](#tab/http)
<!-- { "blockType": "request", "name": "create-folder", "scopes": "files.readwrite" } -->

```http
POST /me/drive/root/children
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "name": "New Folder",
  "folder": { },
  "@microsoft.graph.conflictBehavior": "rename"
}
```

# [C#](#tab/csharp)

```csharp

GraphServiceClient graphClient = new GraphServiceClient( authProvider );

var driveItem = new DriveItem
{
	Name = "New Folder",
	Folder = new Folder
	{
	},
	AdditionalData = new Dictionary<string, object>()
	{
		{"@microsoft.graph.conflictBehavior", "rename"}
	}
};

await graphClient.Me.Drive.Root.Children
	.Request()
	.AddAsync(driveItem);

```


 [!IMPORTANT]
 Microsoft Graph SDKs use the v1.0 version of the API by default, and do not support all the types, properties, and APIs available in the beta version. For details about accessing the beta API with the SDK, see [Use the Microsoft Graph SDKs with the beta API](/graph/sdks/use-beta).

 For details about how to [add the SDK](/graph/sdks/sdk-installation) to your project and [create an authProvider](/graph/sdks/choose-authentication-providers) instance, see the [SDK documentation](/graph/sdks/sdks-overview).

### Response

If successful, this method returns the newly created folder as a [DriveItem][item-resource] resource.
