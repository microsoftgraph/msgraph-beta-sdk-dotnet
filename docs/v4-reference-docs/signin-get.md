# Get signIn

Namespace: microsoft.graph

> [!IMPORTANT]
> APIs under the `/beta` version in Microsoft Graph are subject to change. Use of these APIs in production applications is not supported. To determine whether an API is available in v1.0, use the **Version** selector.

Get a [signIn](../resources/signin.md) object that contains a specific user sign-in event for your tenant. This includes sign-ins where a user is asked to enter a username or password, and session tokens.


>[!NOTE]
>This article describes how to export personal data from a device or service. These steps can be used to support your obligations under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Authorized tenant admins can use Microsoft Graph to correct, update, or delete identifiable information about end users, including customer and employee user profiles or personal data, such as a user's name, work title, address, or phone number, in your [Azure Active Directory (Azure AD)](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/active-directory/) environment.
## Permissions

One of the following permissions is required to call this API. To learn more, including how to choose permissions, see [Permissions](/graph/permissions-reference).

|Permission type      | Permissions (from least to most privileged)              |
|:--------------------|:---------------------------------------------------------|
| Delegated (work or school account) | AuditLog.Read.All and Directory.Read.All |
| Delegated (personal Microsoft account) | Not supported |
| Application | AuditLog.Read.All and Directory.Read.All | 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This API has a [known issue](/graph/known-issues#license-check-errors-for-azure-ad-activity-reports) and currently requires consent to both the **AuditLog.Read.All** and **Directory.Read.All** permissions.

Apps must be [properly registered](/azure/active-directory/active-directory-reporting-api-prerequisites-azure-portal) to Azure AD.

In addition to the delegated permissions, the signed-in user needs to belong to one of the following directory roles that allow them to read sign-in reports. To learn more about directory roles, see [Azure AD built-in roles](/azure/active-directory/roles/permissions-reference):
+ Global Administrator
+ Global Reader
+ Reports Reader
+ Security Administrator
+ Security Operator
+ Security Reader

### Viewing applied conditional access (CA) policies in sign-ins
The applied CA policies listed in **appliedConditionalAccessPolicies** property are only available to users and apps with roles that allow them to read [conditional access data](/graph/api/resources/appliedconditionalaccesspolicy). If a user or app has permissions to read sign-in logs but not permission to read conditional access data, the **appliedConditionalAccessPolicies** property in the response will be omitted. The following Azure AD roles grant users permissions to view conditional access data:

+ Global Administrator
+ Global Reader
+ Security Administrator
+ Security Reader
+ Conditional Access Administrator

Applications must have at least one of the following permissions to see [appliedConditionalAccessPolicy](/graph/api/resources/appliedconditionalaccesspolicy) objects in the sign-in logs: 

+ Policy.Read.All
+ Policy.ReadWrite.ConditionalAccess
+ Policy.Read.ConditionalAccess

>**Note:** Azure AD users with any permissions can read sign-in logs in which their user is the actor signing in. This feature helps users spot unexpected activity in their accounts. Users cannot read CA data from their own logs unless they have one of the CA permissions identified above.

 [!IMPORTANT]
 Microsoft Graph SDKs use the v1.0 version of the API by default, and do not support all the types, properties, and APIs available in the beta version. For details about accessing the beta API with the SDK, see [Use the Microsoft Graph SDKs with the beta API](/graph/sdks/use-beta).

 For details about how to [add the SDK](/graph/sdks/sdk-installation) to your project and [create an authProvider](/graph/sdks/choose-authentication-providers) instance, see the [SDK documentation](/graph/sdks/sdks-overview).
