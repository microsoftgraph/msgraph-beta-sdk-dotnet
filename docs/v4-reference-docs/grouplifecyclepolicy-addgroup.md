> APIs under the `/beta` version in Microsoft Graph are subject to change. Use of these APIs in production applications is not supported. To determine whether an API is available in v1.0, use the **Version** selector.

Adds specific groups to a lifecycle policy. This action limits the group lifecycle policy to a set of groups only if the **managedGroupTypes** property of [groupLifecyclePolicy](../resources/grouplifecyclepolicy.md) is set to `Selected`.

## Permissions

One of the following permissions is required to call this API. To learn more, including how to choose permissions, see [Permissions](/graph/permissions-reference).

| Permission type                        | Permissions (from least to most privileged) |
| :------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------ |
| Delegated (work or school account)     | Directory.ReadWrite.All                     |
| Delegated (personal Microsoft account) | Not supported.                              |
| Application                            | Directory.ReadWrite.All                     |

## HTTP request

<!-- { "blockType": "ignored" } -->

```http
POST /groupLifecyclePolicies/{id}/addGroup
```

## Request headers

| Name          | Description               |
| :------------ | :------------------------ |
| Authorization | Bearer {token}. Required. |

## Request body

In the request body, provide a JSON object with the following parameters.

| :-------- | :----- | :------------------------------------------------ |
| groupId   | String | The identifier of the group to add to the policy. |

When the **managedGroupTypes** property of [groupLifecyclePolicy](../resources/grouplifecyclepolicy.md) is set to `Selected`, you can add up to 500 groups to the list. If you need to add more than 500 groups, the **managedGroupTypes** property of [groupLifecyclePolicy](../resources/grouplifecyclepolicy.md) must be set to `All`.

Only one group can be added per request.

## Response

If successful, this method returns `200 OK` response code. If the group is added to the policy, a `true` value is returned in the response body. Otherwise, a `false` value is returned in the response body.
