# Update device

Namespace: microsoft.graph

> [!IMPORTANT]
> APIs under the `/beta` version in Microsoft Graph are subject to change. Use of these APIs in production applications is not supported. To determine whether an API is available in v1.0, use the **Version** selector.

Update the properties of a device. Only certain properties of a device can be updated through approved Mobile Device Management (MDM) apps.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This API has a [known issue](/graph/known-issues#linux-based-devices-cant-be-updated-by-an-app-with-application-permissions). An app with application permissions can only update the **extensionAttributes** property for Linux-based devices, that is, where the **operationSystem** property is `linux`.

## Permissions
One of the following permissions is required to call this API. To learn more, including how to choose permissions, see [Permissions](/graph/permissions-reference).

|Permission type      | Permissions (from least to most privileged)              |
|:--------------------|:---------------------------------------------------------|
|Delegated (work or school account) | Directory.AccessAsUser.All |
|Delegated (personal Microsoft account) | Not supported. |
|Application | Device.ReadWrite.All, Directory.ReadWrite.All |

The calling user must also be in one of the following [Azure AD roles](/azure/active-directory/roles/permissions-reference): *Global Administrator*, *Intune Administrator*. A calling user in the *Cloud Device Administrator* role can only enable or disable devices using this API and a user with the *Windows 365 Administrator* role can only update basic device properties.

## HTTP request

You can address the device using either its **id** or **deviceId**.
<!-- { "blockType": "ignored" } -->
```http
PATCH /devices/{id}
PATCH /devices(deviceId='{deviceId}')
```

## Request headers
| Name       |Description|
|:-----------|:------|
| Authorization  | Bearer {token}. Required. |

## Request body

In the request body, supply the values for the [device](../resources/device.md) properties that should be updated. Existing properties that are not included in the request body will maintain their previous values or be recalculated based on changes to other property values. For best performance you shouldn't include existing values that haven't changed.

| Property	   | Type	|Description|
|:---------------|:--------|:----------|
|accountEnabled|Boolean| `true` if the account is enabled; otherwise, `false`. Only callers in Global Administrator and Cloud Device Administrator roles can update this property. |
|operatingSystem|String|The type of operating system on the device.|
|operatingSystemVersion|String|The version of the operating system on the device|
|displayName|String|The display name for the device.|
|isCompliant|Boolean|`true` if the device complies with Mobile Device Management (MDM) policies; otherwise, `false`. This can only be updated by Intune for any device OS type or by an [approved MDM app](/windows/client-management/mdm/azure-active-directory-integration-with-mdm) for Windows OS devices. |
|isManaged|Boolean|`true` if the device is managed by a Mobile Device Management (MDM) app; otherwise, `false`. This can only be updated by Intune for any device OS type or by an [approved MDM app](/windows/client-management/mdm/azure-active-directory-integration-with-mdm) for Windows OS devices. |

Since the **device** resource supports [extensions](/graph/extensibility-overview), you can use the `PATCH` operation to 
add, update, or delete your own app-specific data in custom properties of an extension in an existing **device** instance.

## Response

If successful, this method returns a `204 No Content` response code.

## Examples

### Example 1: Update the accountEnabled property of a device

#### Request


# [HTTP](#tab/http)
<!-- {
  "blockType": "request",
  "name": "update_device"
}-->
```http
PATCH https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/devices/7c06cd31-7c30-4f3b-a5c3-444cd8dd63ac
Content-type: application/json

{
  "accountEnabled": false
}
```

# [C#](#tab/csharp)

```csharp

GraphServiceClient graphClient = new GraphServiceClient( authProvider );

var device = new Device
{
	AccountEnabled = false
};

await graphClient.Devices["{device-id}"]
	.Request()
	.UpdateAsync(device);

```


 [!IMPORTANT]
 Microsoft Graph SDKs use the v1.0 version of the API by default, and do not support all the types, properties, and APIs available in the beta version. For details about accessing the beta API with the SDK, see [Use the Microsoft Graph SDKs with the beta API](/graph/sdks/use-beta).

 For details about how to [add the SDK](/graph/sdks/sdk-installation) to your project and [create an authProvider](/graph/sdks/choose-authentication-providers) instance, see the [SDK documentation](/graph/sdks/sdks-overview).

#### Response

<!-- {
  "blockType": "response"
} -->
```http
HTTP/1.1 204 No Content
```

### Example 2:  Write extensionAttributes on a device

#### Request


# [HTTP](#tab/http)
<!-- {

}-->
```msgraph-interactive
PATCH https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/devices/7c06cd31-7c30-4f3b-a5c3-444cd8dd63ac
Content-type: application/json

{
    "extensionAttributes": {
        "extensionAttribute1": "BYOD-Device"
    }
}
```

# [C#](#tab/csharp)

```csharp

GraphServiceClient graphClient = new GraphServiceClient( authProvider );

var device = new Device
{
	ExtensionAttributes = new OnPremisesExtensionAttributes
	{
		ExtensionAttribute1 = "BYOD-Device"
	}
};

await graphClient.Devices["{device-id}"]
	.Request()
	.UpdateAsync(device);
