# Get sharing permission for a file or folder

Namespace: microsoft.graph

> [!IMPORTANT]
> APIs under the `/beta` version in Microsoft Graph are subject to change. Use of these APIs in production applications is not supported. To determine whether an API is available in v1.0, use the **Version** selector.

Return the effective sharing permission for a particular permission resource.

Effective permissions of an item can come from two sources: permissions set directly on the item itself or permissions that are inherited from the item's ancestors.

Callers can differentiate if the permission is inherited or not by checking the `inheritedFrom` property.
This property is an [ItemReference](../resources/itemreference.md) resource referencing the ancestor that the permission is inherited from.

## Permissions

One of the following permissions is required to call this API. To learn more, including how to choose permissions, see [Permissions](/graph/permissions-reference).

|Permission type      | Permissions (from least to most privileged)              |
|:--------------------|:---------------------------------------------------------|
|Delegated (work or school account) | Files.Read, Files.ReadWrite, Files.Read.All, Files.ReadWrite.All, Sites.Read.All, Sites.ReadWrite.All    |
|Delegated (personal Microsoft account) | Files.Read, Files.ReadWrite, Files.Read.All, Files.ReadWrite.All    |
|Application | Files.Read.All, Files.ReadWrite.All, Sites.Read.All, Sites.ReadWrite.All |

## HTTP request

<!-- { "blockType": "ignored" } -->

```http
GET /drives/{drive-id}/items/{item-id}/permissions/{perm-id}
GET /groups/{group-id}/drive/items/{item-id}/permissions/{perm-id}
GET /me/drive/items/{item-id}/permissions/{perm-id}
GET /sites/{site-id}/drive/items/{item-id}/permissions/{perm-id}
GET /users/{user-id}/drive/items/{item-id}/permissions/{perm-id}
```

## Optional query parameters

This method support the [$select query parameter](/graph/query-parameters) to shape the response.

## Response

If successful, this method returns a `200 OK` response code and [Permission](../resources/permission.md) resource in the response body.

## Example

### Request

Here is an example of the request to access a permission on a folder.


# [HTTP](#tab/http)
<!-- { "blockType": "request", "name": "get-item-permission", "scopes": "files.read" } -->

```msgraph-interactive
GET https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/me/drive/items/{item-id}/permissions/{perm-id}
```

# [C#](#tab/csharp)

```csharp

GraphServiceClient graphClient = new GraphServiceClient( authProvider );

var permission = await graphClient.Me.Drive.Items["{driveItem-id}"].Permissions["{permission-id}"]
	.Request()
	.GetAsync();

```


 [!IMPORTANT]
 Microsoft Graph SDKs use the v1.0 version of the API by default, and do not support all the types, properties, and APIs available in the beta version. For details about accessing the beta API with the SDK, see [Use the Microsoft Graph SDKs with the beta API](/graph/sdks/use-beta).

 For details about how to [add the SDK](/graph/sdks/sdk-installation) to your project and [create an authProvider](/graph/sdks/choose-authentication-providers) instance, see the [SDK documentation](/graph/sdks/sdks-overview).

### Response

If successful, this method returns a [Permission](../resources/permission.md) resource for the specified ID. 

<!-- {"blockType": "response", "@odata.type": "microsoft.graph.permission", "truncated": true} -->

```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-type: application/json

{
  "@deprecated.GrantedTo": "GrantedTo has been deprecated. Refer to GrantedToV2",
  "grantedTo": {
    "user": {
      "displayName": "Robin Danielsen",
      "id": "efee1b77-fb3b-4f65-99d6-274c11914d12"
    }
  },
  "grantedToV2": {
    "user": {
      "id": "efee1b77-fb3b-4f65-99d6-274c11914d12",
      "displayName": "Robin Danielsen"
    },
    "siteUser": {
      "id": "1",

      "loginName": "Robin Danielsen"
    }
  },
  "id": "1",
  "roles": [ "write" ]
}
```

## Remarks

The [Permission](../resources/permission.md) resource uses _facets_ to provide information about the kind of permission represented by the resource.

Permissions with a [**link**](../resources/sharinglink.md) facet represent sharing links created on the item. 
Sharing links contain a unique token that provides access to the item for anyone with the link.

Permissions with a [**invitation**](../resources/sharinginvitation.md) facet represent permissions added by inviting specific users or groups to have access to the file.
