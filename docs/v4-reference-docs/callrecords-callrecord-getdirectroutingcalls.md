# callRecord: getDirectRoutingCalls

Namespace: microsoft.graph.callRecords

> [!IMPORTANT]
> APIs under the `/beta` version in Microsoft Graph are subject to change. Use of these APIs in production applications is not supported. To determine whether an API is available in v1.0, use the **Version** selector.

Get a log of direct routing calls as a collection of [directRoutingLogRow](../resources/callrecords-directroutinglogrow.md) entries.

## Permissions

One of the following permissions is required to call this API. To learn more, including how to choose permissions, see [Permissions](/graph/permissions-reference).

|Permission type|Permissions (from least to most privileged)|
|:---------------------------------------|:--------------------------------------------|
| Delegated (work or school account)     | Not supported. |
| Delegated (personal Microsoft account) | Not supported. |
| Application                            | CallRecord-PstnCalls.Read.All, CallRecords.Read.All |

## HTTP request

<!-- {
  "blockType": "ignored"
}
-->

``` http
GET /communications/callRecords/getDirectRoutingCalls
```

## Request headers

|Name|Description|
|:---|:---|
|Authorization|Bearer {token}. Required.|

## Function parameters

In the request URL, provide the following query parameters with values.
The following table shows the parameters that can be used with this function.

|Parameter|Type|Description|
|:---|:---|:---|
|fromDateTime|DateTimeOffset|Start of time range to query. UTC, inclusive.<br/>Time range is based on the call start time.|
|toDateTime|DateTimeOffset|End of time range to query. UTC, exclusive.|

## Response

If successful, this function returns a `200 OK` response code and a collection of [directRoutingLogRow](../resources/callrecords-directroutinglogrow.md) entries in the response body.
  
If there are more than 1000 entries in the date range, the body also includes an `@odata.NextLink` with a URL to query the next page of call entries. The last page in the date range does not have `@odata.NextLink`. For more information, see [paging Microsoft Graph data in your app](/graph/paging).

## Example

The following example shows how to get a collection of records for direct routing calls that occurred in the specified date range. The response includes `"@odata.count": 1000` to enumerate the number of records in this first response, and `@odata.NextLink` to get records beyond the first 1000. For readability, the response shows only a collection of 1 record. Please assume there are more than 1000 calls in that date range.

### Request


# [HTTP](#tab/http)
<!-- {
  "blockType": "request",

}
-->

``` http
GET https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/communications/callRecords/getDirectRoutingCalls(fromDateTime=2019-11-01,toDateTime=2019-12-01)
```

# [C#](#tab/csharp)

```


 [!IMPORTANT]
 Microsoft Graph SDKs use the v1.0 version of the API by default, and do not support all the types, properties, and APIs available in the beta version. For details about accessing the beta API with the SDK, see [Use the Microsoft Graph SDKs with the beta API](/graph/sdks/use-beta).

 For details about how to [add the SDK](/graph/sdks/sdk-installation) to your project and [create an authProvider](/graph/sdks/choose-authentication-providers) instance, see the [SDK documentation](/graph/sdks/sdks-overview).
