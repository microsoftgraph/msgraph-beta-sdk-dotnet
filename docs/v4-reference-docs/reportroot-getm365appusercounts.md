# reportRoot: getM365AppUserCounts

Namespace: microsoft.graph

> [!IMPORTANT]
> APIs under the `/beta` version in Microsoft Graph are subject to change. Use of these APIs in production applications is not supported. To determine whether an API is available in v1.0, use the **Version** selector.

Get a report that provides the trend in the number of active users for each app (Outlook, Word, Excel, PowerPoint, OneNote, and Teams) in your organization.

> **Note:** For details about different report views and names, see [Microsoft 365 Reports in the admin center - Microsoft 365 Apps usage](/microsoft-365/admin/activity-reports/microsoft365-apps-usage).

## Permissions

One of the following permissions is required to call this API. To learn more, including how to choose permissions, see [Permissions](/graph/permissions-reference).

| Permission type                        | Permissions (from least to most privileged) |
| :------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------ |
| Delegated (work or school account)     | Reports.Read.All                            |

> **Note:** For delegated permissions to allow apps to read service usage reports on behalf of a user, the tenant administrator must have assigned the user the appropriate Azure Active Directory limited administrator role. For more details, see [Authorization for APIs to read Microsoft 365 usage reports](/graph/reportroot-authorization).

## Optional query parameters

This method supports the `$format` [OData query parameter](/graph/query-parameters) to customize the response. The default output type is `text/csv`. However, if you want to specify the output type, you can use the OData `$format` query parameter to set the default output to `text/csv` or `application/json`.

## Response

### CSV

- OneNote
- Teams

### JSON

If successful, this method returns a `200 OK` response code and a JSON object in the response body.
