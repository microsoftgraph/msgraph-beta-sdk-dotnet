# Create invitation

Namespace: microsoft.graph

> [!IMPORTANT]
> APIs under the `/beta` version in Microsoft Graph are subject to change. Use of these APIs in production applications is not supported. To determine whether an API is available in v1.0, use the **Version** selector.

Use this API to create a new [invitation](../resources/invitation.md). Invitation adds an external user to the organization.

When creating a new invitation you have several options available:

1. On invitation creation, Microsoft Graph can automatically send an invitation email directly to the invited user, or your app can use the *inviteRedeemUrl* returned in the creation response to craft your own invitation (through your communication mechanism of choice) to the invited user. If you decide to have Microsoft Graph send an invitation email automatically, you can control the content and language of the email using [*invitedUserMessageInfo*](../resources/invitedusermessageinfo.md).
2. When the user is invited, a user entity (of userType Guest) is created and can now be used to control access to resources. The invited user has to go through the redemption process to access any resources they have been invited to.

 [!IMPORTANT]
 Microsoft Graph SDKs use the v1.0 version of the API by default, and do not support all the types, properties, and APIs available in the beta version. For details about accessing the beta API with the SDK, see [Use the Microsoft Graph SDKs with the beta API](/graph/sdks/use-beta).

 For details about how to [add the SDK](/graph/sdks/sdk-installation) to your project and [create an authProvider](/graph/sdks/choose-authentication-providers) instance, see the [SDK documentation](/graph/sdks/sdks-overview).
