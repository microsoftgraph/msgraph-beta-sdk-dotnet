# educationSubmission: reassign

Namespace: microsoft.graph

> [!IMPORTANT]
> APIs under the `/beta` version in Microsoft Graph are subject to change. Use of these APIs in production applications is not supported. To determine whether an API is available in v1.0, use the **Version** selector.

Reassign the [submission](../resources/educationsubmission.md) to the student with feedback for review.

Only teachers can perform this action. 

Include the `Prefer: include-unknown-enum-members` header when you call this method; otherwise, a reassigned submission will be treated as a returned submission. This means that the `reassigned` status will be mapped to the `returned` status, and **reassignedDateTime** and **reassignedBy** properties will be mapped to **returnedDateTime** and **returnedBy** respectively.

If the header `Prefer: include-unknown-enum-members` is provided, a reassigned submission retains the `reassigned` status. For details, see the examples section.

## Permissions
One of the following permissions is required to call this API. To learn more, including how to choose permissions, see [Permissions](/graph/permissions-reference).

|Permission type      | Permissions (from least to most privileged)              |
|:--------------------|:---------------------------------------------------------|
|Delegated (work or school account) |  EduAssignments.ReadWriteBasic, EduAssignments.ReadWrite   |
|Delegated (personal Microsoft account) |  Not supported.  |
|Application | Notes.ReadWrite.All, EduAssignments.ReadWrite.All | 

## HTTP request
<!-- { "blockType": "ignored" } -->
```http
POST /education/classes/{id}/assignments/{id}/submissions/{id}/reassign
```
## Request headers
| Header       | Value |
|:---------------|:--------|
| Authorization  | Bearer {token}. Required.  |
| Prefer  | `include-unknown-enum-members`. Optional.  |

## Request body
Don't supply a request body for this method.

## Response
If successful, this method returns `200 OK` response code and an [educationSubmission](../resources/educationsubmission.md) object in the response body.

 [!IMPORTANT]
 Microsoft Graph SDKs use the v1.0 version of the API by default, and do not support all the types, properties, and APIs available in the beta version. For details about accessing the beta API with the SDK, see [Use the Microsoft Graph SDKs with the beta API](/graph/sdks/use-beta).

 For details about how to [add the SDK](/graph/sdks/sdk-installation) to your project and [create an authProvider](/graph/sdks/choose-authentication-providers) instance, see the [SDK documentation](/graph/sdks/sdks-overview).

#### Response
The following is an example of the response when `Prefer: include-unknown-enum-members` is NOT provided in the request header and the submission hasn't been returned before.
