# externalItem: addActivities
Namespace: microsoft.graph.externalConnectors

> [!IMPORTANT]
> APIs under the `/beta` version in Microsoft Graph are subject to change. Use of these APIs in production applications is not supported. To determine whether an API is available in v1.0, use the **Version** selector.

Append additional instances of [externalActivity](../resources/externalconnectors-externalactivity.md) objects on an [externalitem](../resources/externalconnectors-externalitem.md).

One of the following permissions is required to call this API. To learn more, including how to choose permissions, see [Permissions](/graph/permissions-reference).

| Permission type                        | Permissions (from least to most privileged) |
|:---------------------------------------|:--------------------------------------------|
| Delegated (work or school account)     | Not supported                               |
| Delegated (personal Microsoft account) | Not supported                               |
| Application                            | ExternalItem.ReadWrite.OwnedBy, ExternalItem.ReadWrite.All                 |

## HTTP request

<!-- {
  "blockType": "ignored"
}
-->
``` http
POST /connections/{connectionsId}/items/{externalItemId}/addActivities
```

## Request headers
|Name|Description|
|:---|:---|
|Authorization|Bearer {token}. Required.|
|Content-Type|application/json. Required.|

## Request body
In the request body, supply JSON representation of the parameters.

The following table shows the parameters that can be used with this action.

|Parameter|Type|Description|
|:---|:---|:---|
|activities|[microsoft.graph.externalConnectors.externalActivity](../resources/externalconnectors-externalactivity.md) collection|Collection of activities involving an **externalItem**.|



## Response

If successful, this action returns a `200 OK` response code and a collection of [externalConnectors.externalActivityResult](../resources/externalconnectors-externalactivityresult.md) objects in the response body.

If a `207` response is returned, this indicates that only some of the added **externalActivity** instances were successfully processed. The caller should inspect the response payload, looking at the error field for each **externalActivityResult** to determine why the **externalActivity** instance was not processed and what action can be taken. If the error field is null, that indicates a successful **externalActivityResult**.

## Examples

### Request

The following is an example of a request.


# [HTTP](#tab/http)
<!-- {
  "blockType": "request",
  "name": "externalitemthis.addactivities"
}
-->
``` http
POST https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/connections/{connectionsId}/items/{externalItemId}/addActivities
Content-Type: application/json
Content-length: 190

{
  "activities": [
    {
      "@odata.type": "#microsoft.graph.externalConnectors.externalActivity",
      "type": "String",
      "startDateTime": "String (timestamp)"
    }
  ]
}
```

# [C#](#tab/csharp)

```csharp

GraphServiceClient graphClient = new GraphServiceClient( authProvider );

var activities = new List<Microsoft.Graph.ExternalConnectors.ExternalActivity>()
{
	new Microsoft.Graph.ExternalConnectors.ExternalActivity
	{
		Type = Microsoft.Graph.ExternalConnectors.ExternalActivityType.Viewed,
		StartDateTime = DateTimeOffset.Parse("String (timestamp)")
	}
};

await graphClient.Connections["{externalConnectors.externalConnection-id}"].Items["{externalConnectors.externalItem-id}"]
	.AddActivities(activities)
	.Request()
	.PostAsync();

```


 [!IMPORTANT]
 Microsoft Graph SDKs use the v1.0 version of the API by default, and do not support all the types, properties, and APIs available in the beta version. For details about accessing the beta API with the SDK, see [Use the Microsoft Graph SDKs with the beta API](/graph/sdks/use-beta).

 For details about how to [add the SDK](/graph/sdks/sdk-installation) to your project and [create an authProvider](/graph/sdks/choose-authentication-providers) instance, see the [SDK documentation](/graph/sdks/sdks-overview).
