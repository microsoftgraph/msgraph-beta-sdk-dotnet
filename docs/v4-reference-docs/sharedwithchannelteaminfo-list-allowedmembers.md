# List allowedMembers
Namespace: microsoft.graph

> [!IMPORTANT]
> APIs under the `/beta` version in Microsoft Graph are subject to change. Use of these APIs in production applications is not supported. To determine whether an API is available in v1.0, use the **Version** selector.

Get the list of [conversationMembers](../resources/conversationmember.md) who can access a shared [channel](../resources/channel.md).

This method does not return the following [conversationMembers](../resources/conversationmember.md) from the [team](../resources/team.md):
- Users with `Guest` role
- Users who are externally authenticated in the tenant

> [!NOTE]
> The membership ID returned by the server must be treated as an opaque string. The client should not try to parse or make any assumptions about this ID.
>
> The membership results can map to users from different tenants, as indicated in the response, in the future. The client should not assume that all members are only from the current tenant.

 [!IMPORTANT]
 Microsoft Graph SDKs use the v1.0 version of the API by default, and do not support all the types, properties, and APIs available in the beta version. For details about accessing the beta API with the SDK, see [Use the Microsoft Graph SDKs with the beta API](/graph/sdks/use-beta).

 For details about how to [add the SDK](/graph/sdks/sdk-installation) to your project and [create an authProvider](/graph/sdks/choose-authentication-providers) instance, see the [SDK documentation](/graph/sdks/sdks-overview).
