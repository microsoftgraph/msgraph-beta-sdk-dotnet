> APIs under the `/beta` version in Microsoft Graph are subject to change. Use of these APIs in production applications is not supported. To determine whether an API is available in v1.0, use the **Version** selector.

Retrieve a list of [tasks](../resources/printtask.md) associated with a [task definition](../resources/printtaskdefinition.md).

For details about how to use this API to add pull printing support to Universal Print, see [Extending Universal Print to support pull printing](/graph/universal-print-concept-overview#extending-universal-print-to-support-pull-printing).

## Permissions
One of the following permissions is required to call this API. To learn more, including how to choose permissions, see [Permissions](/graph/permissions-reference).

In addition to the following permissions, the user's tenant must have an active Universal Print subscription.

|Permission type | Permissions (from least to most privileged) |
|:---------------|:--------------------------------------------|
|Delegated (work or school account)| Not supported. |
|Delegated (personal Microsoft account)|Not Supported.|
|Application| PrintTaskDefinition.ReadWrite.All |

# [HTTP](#tab/http)
<!-- {
  "blockType": "request",
  "name": "get_printtaskdefinition_tasks"
}-->
```msgraph-interactive
GET https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/print/taskDefinitions/92d72a3d-cad7-4809-8924-43833282b079/tasks

 [!IMPORTANT]
 Microsoft Graph SDKs use the v1.0 version of the API by default, and do not support all the types, properties, and APIs available in the beta version. For details about accessing the beta API with the SDK, see [Use the Microsoft Graph SDKs with the beta API](/graph/sdks/use-beta).

 For details about how to [add the SDK](/graph/sdks/sdk-installation) to your project and [create an authProvider](/graph/sdks/choose-authentication-providers) instance, see the [SDK documentation](/graph/sdks/sdks-overview).
