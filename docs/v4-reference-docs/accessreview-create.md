# Create accessReview (deprecated)

Namespace: microsoft.graph

> [!IMPORTANT]
> APIs under the `/beta` version in Microsoft Graph are subject to change. Use of these APIs in production applications is not supported. To determine whether an API is available in v1.0, use the **Version** selector.

>[!CAUTION]
>This version of the access review API is deprecated and will stop returning data on May 19, 2023. Please use [access reviews API](/graph/api/resources/accessreviewsv2-overview?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true).
In the Azure AD [access reviews](../resources/accessreviews-root.md) feature, create a new [accessReview](../resources/accessreview.md) object.

Before making this request, the caller must have previously [retrieved the list of business flow templates](businessflowtemplate-list.md), to have the value of **businessFlowTemplateId** to include in the request.

After making this request, the caller should [create a programControl](programcontrol-create.md), to link the access review to a program.  

## Permissions

One of the following permissions is required to call this API. To learn more, including how to choose permissions, see [Permissions](/graph/permissions-reference).

|Permission type                        | Permissions (from least to most privileged)              |
|:--------------------------------------|:---------------------------------------------------------|
|Delegated (work or school account)     | AccessReview.ReadWrite.Membership, AccessReview.ReadWrite.All |
|Delegated (personal Microsoft account) | Not supported. |
|Application                            | AccessReview.ReadWrite.Membership |

The caller should also have ProgramControl.ReadWrite.All permission, so that after creating an access review, the caller can create a [programControl](../resources/programcontrol.md).
In addition, the signed in user must also be in a directory role that permits them to create an access review.  For more details, see the role and permission requirements for [access reviews](../resources/accessreviews-root.md).

## HTTP request
<!-- { "blockType": "ignored" } -->
```http
POST /accessReviews
```
## Request headers
| Name         | Description |
|:-------------|:------------|
| Authorization | Bearer \{token\}. Required. |
| Content-type | application/json. Required. |

## Request body
In the request body, supply a JSON representation of an [accessReview](../resources/accessreview.md) object.

The following table shows the properties that are required when you create an accessReview.

| Property     | Type        | Description |
|:-------------|:------------|:------------|
| displayName             |String                                                        | The access review name.  |
| startDateTime           |DateTimeOffset                                                | The DateTime when the review is scheduled to be start.  This must be a date in the future.   |
| endDateTime             |DateTimeOffset                                                | The DateTime when the review is scheduled to end. This must be at least one day later than the start date.   |
| description             |String                                                        | The description, to show to the reviewers. |
| businessFlowTemplateId  |String                                                        | The business flow template identifier, obtained from a [businessFlowTemplate](../resources/businessflowtemplate.md).  |
| reviewerType            |String                                                        | The relationship type of reviewer to the access rights of the reviewed object, one of `self`, `delegated`, or `entityOwners`. | 
| reviewedEntity          |[identity](../resources/identity.md)                                     | The object for which an access review is created, such as the membership of a group or the assignments of users to an application. | 


If the **reviewerType** has the value `delegated`, then the caller must also include the **reviewers** property, with a collection of [userIdentity](../resources/useridentity.md) objects representing the reviewers.

If your app is calling this API without a signed-in user, then the caller must also include the **createdBy** property, the value for which is a [userIdentity](../resources/useridentity.md) of the user who will be identified as the creator of the review.

In addition, the caller can include **settings**, to create a recurring review series or to change from the default review behavior. In particular, to create a recurring review, the caller must include the [accessReviewRecurrenceSettings](../resources/accessreviewrecurrencesettings.md) within the access review settings,


## Response
If successful, this method returns a `201 Created` response code and an [accessReview](../resources/accessreview.md) object in the response body.

## Example

This is an example of creating a one-time (not recurring) access review, explicitly specifying two users as the reviewers.

### Request
In the request body, supply a JSON representation of the [accessReview](../resources/accessreview.md) object.

 [!IMPORTANT]
 Microsoft Graph SDKs use the v1.0 version of the API by default, and do not support all the types, properties, and APIs available in the beta version. For details about accessing the beta API with the SDK, see [Use the Microsoft Graph SDKs with the beta API](/graph/sdks/use-beta).

 For details about how to [add the SDK](/graph/sdks/sdk-installation) to your project and [create an authProvider](/graph/sdks/choose-authentication-providers) instance, see the [SDK documentation](/graph/sdks/sdks-overview).
