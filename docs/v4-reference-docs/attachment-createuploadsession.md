Namespace: microsoft.graph

> [!IMPORTANT]
> APIs under the `/beta` version in Microsoft Graph are subject to change. Use of these APIs in production applications is not supported. To determine whether an API is available in v1.0, use the **Version** selector.

Create an upload session that allows an app to iteratively upload ranges of a file, so as to attach the file to an Outlook item. The item can be a [message](../resources/message.md) or [event](../resources/event.md).

Use this approach to attach a file if the file size is between 3 MB and 150 MB. To attach a file that's smaller than 3 MB, do a `POST` operation on the **attachments** navigation property of the Outlook item; see how to do this [for a message](message-post-attachments.md) or [for an event](event-post-attachments.md). 

As part of the response, this action returns an upload URL that you can use in subsequent sequential `PUT` queries. Request headers for each `PUT` operation let you specify the exact range of bytes to be uploaded. This allows transfer to be resumed, in case the network connection is dropped during upload. 

The following are the steps to attach a file to an Outlook item using an upload session:

1. Create an upload session.
2. Within that upload session, iteratively upload ranges of bytes (up to 4 MB each time) until all the bytes of the file have been uploaded, and the file is attached to the specified item.
3. Save the ID for the attachment for future access.
4. Optional: Delete the upload session.

See [attach large files to Outlook messages or events](/graph/outlook-large-attachments) for an example.

> [!TIP]
> Exchange Online lets administrators customize the message size limit for Microsoft 365 mailboxes,  including any message attachments. By default, this message size limit is 35 MB. Find out how to [customize the maximum message size](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/blog/2015/04/15/office-365-now-supports-larger-email-messages-up-to-150-mb) to support attachments larger than the default limit for your tenant. 

> [!IMPORTANT] 
> Be aware of a [known issue](/graph/known-issues#attaching-large-files-to-messages) if you're attaching a large file to a message or event in a shared or delegated mailbox.


## Permissions

One of the following permissions is required to call this API. To learn more, including how to choose permissions, see [Permissions](/graph/permissions-reference).

| Permission type                        | Permissions (from least to most privileged) |
|:---------------------------------------|:--------------------------------------------|
| Delegated (work or school account)     | Mail.ReadWrite |
| Delegated (personal Microsoft account) | Mail.ReadWrite |
| Application                            | Mail.ReadWrite |

## HTTP request

To create an upload session for attaching a file to an **event**: 

<!-- { "blockType": "ignored" } -->
```http
POST /me/events/{id}/attachments/createUploadSession
```

To create an upload session for attaching a file to a **message**: 

<!-- { "blockType": "ignored" } -->
```http
POST /me/messages/{id}/attachments/createUploadSession
```

## Request headers

| Name          | Description   |
|:--------------|:--------------|
| Authorization | Bearer {token} |


## Request body

In the request body, provide a JSON object with the following parameters.

| Parameter    | Type        | Description |
|:-------------|:------------|:------------|
|AttachmentItem|[attachmentItem](../resources/attachmentitem.md)|Represents attributes of the item to be uploaded and attached. At minimum, specify the attachment type (`file`), a name, and the size of the file.|

## Response

If successful, this method returns a `201 Created` response code and a new [uploadSession](../resources/uploadsession.md) object in the response body.

>**Note**: 
>
>The **uploadUrl** property returned as part of the **uploadSession** response object is an opaque URL for subsequent `PUT` queries to upload byte ranges of the file. It contains the appropriate auth token for subsequent `PUT` queries that expire by **expirationDateTime**. Do not customize this URL.
>
>The **nextExpectedRanges** property specifies the next file byte location to upload from, for example, `"NextExpectedRanges":["2097152"]`. You must upload bytes in a file in order.

<!-- The **nextExpectedRanges** property specifies one or more ranges of bytes that the server is still missing for the file. These ranges are zero-indexed and of the format `{start}-{end}`, unless if the server misses the remainder of the bytes from the start of that range, in which case the format is simply `{start}`.  -->


## Examples

### Example 1: Create an upload session to add a large attachment to a draft message
The following example shows how to create an upload session that you can use in subsequent file upload operations to the specified message.

### Example 2: Create an upload session to add a large in-line attachment to a draft message

The following example shows how to create an upload session that can be used to add a large inline attachment to a draft message.

For an inline attachment, set _isInline_ property to `true` and use the _contentId_ property to specify a CID for the attachment as shown below. In the body of the draft message, use the same CID value to indicate the position where you want to include the attachment using a CID HTML reference tag, for example `<img src="cid:my_inline_picture">`. Upon successfully uploading the file, the rendered message will include the attachment as part of the message body in the specified location.
