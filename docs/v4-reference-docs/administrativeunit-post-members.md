# Add a member

Namespace: microsoft.graph

> [!IMPORTANT]
> APIs under the `/beta` version in Microsoft Graph are subject to change. Use of these APIs in production applications is not supported. To determine whether an API is available in v1.0, use the **Version** selector.

Use this API to add a member (user, group, or device) to an administrative unit or to create a new group within an administrative unit. All [group types](/graph/api/resources/groups-overview) can be created within an administrative unit.

**Note:** Currently, it's only possible to add one member at a time to an administrative unit.`

## Permissions
One of the following permissions is required to call this API. To learn more, including how to choose permissions, see [Permissions](/graph/permissions-reference).

### Permissions to add an existing user, group, or device
|Permission type      | Permissions (from least to most privileged)              |
|:--------------------|:---------------------------------------------------------|
|Delegated (work or school account) | AdministrativeUnit.ReadWrite.All    |
|Delegated (personal Microsoft account) | Not supported.    |
|Application | AdministrativeUnit.ReadWrite.All |

To add a user, group, or device to an administrative unit, the calling principal must be assigned one of the following [Azure AD roles](/azure/active-directory/roles/permissions-reference):

* Privileged Role Administrator
* Global Administrator

### Permissions to create a new group
|Permission type      | Permissions (from least to most privileged)              |
|:--------------------|:---------------------------------------------------------|
|Delegated (work or school account) | Directory.ReadWrite.All    |
|Delegated (personal Microsoft account) | Not supported.    |
|Application | Directory.ReadWrite.All |

To create a new group in an administrative unit, the calling principal must be assigned one of the following [Azure AD roles](/azure/active-directory/roles/permissions-reference):

* Privileged Role Administrator
* Global Administrator
* Groups Administrator

## HTTP request

The following request adds an existing user, group, or device to the administrative unit.
<!-- { "blockType": "ignored" } -->
```http
POST /administrativeUnits/{id}/members/$ref
```

The following request creates a new group within the administrative unit.
<!-- { "blockType": "ignored" } -->
```http
POST /administrativeUnits/{id}/members
```

## Request headers
| Name      |Description|
|:----------|:----------|
| Authorization  | Bearer {token}. Required. |
| Content-type  | application/json. Required. |

### Adding an existing user or group
In the request body, provide the `id` of a [user](../resources/user.md),  [group](../resources/group.md), [device](../resources/device.md), or [directoryObject](../resources/directoryobject.md) to be added.

### Creating a new group
The following table shows the properties of the [group](../resources/group.md) resource to specify when you create a group in the administrative unit.

| Property | Type | Description|
|:---------------|:--------|:----------|
| displayName | string | The name to display in the address book for the group. Required. |
| description | string | A description for the group. Optional. |
| isAssignableToRole | Boolean | Set to **true** to enable the group to be assigned to an Azure AD role. Only Privileged Role Administrator and Global Administrator can set the value of this property. Optional. |
| mailEnabled | boolean | Set to **true** for mail-enabled groups. Required. |
| mailNickname | string | The mail alias for the group. These characters cannot be used in the mailNickName: `@()\[]";:.<>,SPACE`. Required. |
| securityEnabled | boolean | Set to **true** for security-enabled groups, including Microsoft 365 groups. Required. |
| owners | [directoryObject](../resources/directoryobject.md) collection | This property represents the owners for the group at creation time. Optional. |
| members | [directoryObject](../resources/directoryobject.md) collection | This property represents the members for the group at creation time. Optional. |
|visibility|String|Specifies the visibility of a Microsoft 365 group. Possible values are: `Private`, `Public`, `HiddenMembership`, or empty (which is interpreted as `Public`).|

## Response

If successful, adding an existing object (using `$ref`) returns `204 No Content` response code. It does not return anything in the response body. 

When creating a new group (without `$ref`), this method returns a `201 Created` response code and a [group](../resources/group.md) object in the response body. The response includes only the default properties of the group. You must supply the `"@odata.type" : "#microsoft.graph.group"` line in the request body to explicitly identify the new member as a group. A request body without the correct @odata.type returns a `400 Bad Request` error message.

## Examples
### Example 1: Add an existing user or group
The following will add an existing user or group to the administrative unit.

#### Request
The following is an example of the request.


# [HTTP](#tab/http)
<!-- {
  "blockType": "request",
  "name": "post_administrativeunits_members_ref"
} -->
```http
POST https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/administrativeUnits/{id}/members/$ref
Content-type: application/json

{
  "@odata.id":"https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/groups/{id}"
}
```

# [C#](#tab/csharp)

```csharp

GraphServiceClient graphClient = new GraphServiceClient( authProvider );

var directoryObject = new DirectoryObject
{
	Id = "{id}"
};

await graphClient.AdministrativeUnits["{administrativeUnit-id}"].Members.References
	.Request()
	.AddAsync(directoryObject);

```


 [!IMPORTANT]
 Microsoft Graph SDKs use the v1.0 version of the API by default, and do not support all the types, properties, and APIs available in the beta version. For details about accessing the beta API with the SDK, see [Use the Microsoft Graph SDKs with the beta API](/graph/sdks/use-beta).

 For details about how to [add the SDK](/graph/sdks/sdk-installation) to your project and [create an authProvider](/graph/sdks/choose-authentication-providers) instance, see the [SDK documentation](/graph/sdks/sdks-overview).

#### Response

The following is an example of the response.
 
<!-- {
  "blockType": "response",
  "truncated": true,
  "name": "post_administrativeunits_members_ref"
} -->
```http
HTTP/1.1 204 No Content
```

### Example 2: Create a new group
The following example creates a new group in the administrative unit. You must supply the `"@odata.type" : "#microsoft.graph.group"` line in the request body to explicitly identify the new member as a group. A request body without the correct @odata.type returns a `400 Bad Request` error message.

#### Request
The following is an example of the request.

# [HTTP](#tab/http)
<!-- {
  "blockType": "request",
  "name": "post_administrativeunits_members"
} -->
``` http
POST https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/administrativeUnits/{id}/members
Content-type: application/json

{
  "@odata.type": "#microsoft.graph.group",
  "description": "Self help community for golf",
  "displayName": "Golf Assist",
  "groupTypes": [
    "Unified"
  ],
  "mailEnabled": true,
  "mailNickname": "golfassist",
  "securityEnabled": false
}
```

# [C#](#tab/csharp)

```csharp

GraphServiceClient graphClient = new GraphServiceClient( authProvider );

var directoryObject = new Group
{
	Description = "Self help community for golf",
	DisplayName = "Golf Assist",
	GroupTypes = new List<String>()
	{
		"Unified"
	},
	MailEnabled = true,
	MailNickname = "golfassist",
	SecurityEnabled = false
};

await graphClient.AdministrativeUnits["{administrativeUnit-id}"].Members
	.Request()
	.AddAsync(directoryObject);

```
