## Examples

### Example 1: Create a new workforceIntegration object.

#### Request

The following is an example of a request to create a new **workforceIntegration** object.

# [HTTP](#tab/http)
<!-- {
  "blockType": "request",
  "name": "create_workforceintegration_from_teamwork"
}-->

```http
POST https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/teamwork/workforceIntegrations

```

# [C#](#tab/csharp)

```csharp

GraphServiceClient graphClient = new GraphServiceClient( authProvider );

var workforceIntegration = new WorkforceIntegration
{
	DisplayName = "displayName-value",
	ApiVersion = 99,
	Encryption = new WorkforceIntegrationEncryption
	{
		Protocol = WorkforceIntegrationEncryptionProtocol.SharedSecret,
		Secret = "secret-value"
	},
	IsActive = true,

```


 [!IMPORTANT]
 Microsoft Graph SDKs use the v1.0 version of the API by default, and do not support all the types, properties, and APIs available in the beta version. For details about accessing the beta API with the SDK, see [Use the Microsoft Graph SDKs with the beta API](/graph/sdks/use-beta).

 For details about how to [add the SDK](/graph/sdks/sdk-installation) to your project and [create an authProvider](/graph/sdks/choose-authentication-providers) instance, see the [SDK documentation](/graph/sdks/sdks-overview).

#### Response

The following is an example of the response.

Authorization: Bearer {token}
Content-type: application/json

{
  "displayName": "ABCWorkforceIntegration",
  "apiVersion": 1,
  "isActive": true,
  "encryption": {
    "protocol": "sharedSecret",
    "secret": "My Secret"
  },

}

```
#### Response

The following is an example of the response.
```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
{

  "displayName": "ABCWorkforceIntegration",
  "apiVersion": 1,
  "isActive": true,

To update an existing **workforceIntegration** object with SwapRequest enabled for eligibility filtering, see the [Update](../api/workforceintegration-update.md) method.

### Example 3: Fetching eligible shifts when SwapRequest is included in eligibilityFilteringEnabledEntities

The interaction between Shifts app and workforce integration endpoints will follow the existing pattern.

### Request

The following is an example of the request made by Shifts to the workforce integration endpoint to fetch eligible shifts for a swap request.

```
POST https://abcWorkforceIntegration.com/Contoso/{apiVersion}/team/{teamId}/read
Accept-Language: en-us

{
  "requests": [
  {
     "id": "{shiftId}",
     "method": "GETâ€,
     "url": â€œ/shifts/{shiftId}/requestableShifts?requestType={requestType}&startDateTime={startDateTime}&endDateTime={endDateTime}â€
   }]
}
```
### Response

The following is an example of the response from the workforce integration service.
```
