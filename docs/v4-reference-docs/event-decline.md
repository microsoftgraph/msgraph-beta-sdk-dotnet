# event: decline

Namespace: microsoft.graph

> [!IMPORTANT]
> APIs under the `/beta` version in Microsoft Graph are subject to change. Use of these APIs in production applications is not supported. To determine whether an API is available in v1.0, use the **Version** selector.

Decline invitation to the specified [event](../resources/event.md) in a user [calendar](../resources/calendar.md).

If the event allows proposals for new times, on declining the event, an invitee can choose to suggest an alternative time by including the **proposedNewTime** parameter. For more information on how to propose a time, and how to receive and accept a new time proposal, see [Propose new meeting times](/graph/outlook-calendar-meeting-proposals).
