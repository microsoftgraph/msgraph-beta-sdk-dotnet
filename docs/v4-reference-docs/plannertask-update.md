# Update plannertask

Namespace: microsoft.graph

> [!IMPORTANT]
> APIs under the `/beta` version in Microsoft Graph are subject to change. Use of these APIs in production applications is not supported. To determine whether an API is available in v1.0, use the **Version** selector.

Update the properties of **plannertask** object.

## Permissions

One of the following permissions is required to call this API. To learn more, including how to choose permissions, see [Permissions](/graph/permissions-reference).

|Permission type      | Permissions (from least to most privileged)              |
|:--------------------|:---------------------------------------------------------|
|Delegated (work or school account) | Tasks.ReadWrite, Group.ReadWrite.All    |
|Delegated (personal Microsoft account) | Not supported.    |
|Application | Tasks.ReadWrite.All |

## HTTP request
<!-- { "blockType": "ignored" } -->
```http
PATCH /planner/tasks/{id}
```
## Optional request headers
| Name       | Description|
|:-----------|:-----------|
| Authorization  | Bearer {token}. Required. |
| If-Match  | Last known ETag value for the **plannerTask** to be updated. Required.|

## Request body

In the request body, supply *only* the values for properties that should be updated. Existing properties that are not included in the request body will maintain their previous values or be recalculated based on changes to other property values.

The following table specifies the properties that can be updated.

| Property	   | Type	|Description|
|:---------------|:--------|:----------|
|appliedCategories|[plannerAppliedCategories](../resources/plannerappliedcategories.md)|The categories to which the task has been applied. See [applied Categories](../resources/plannerappliedcategories.md) for possible values.|
|assigneePriority|String|Hint used to order items of this type in a list view. The format is defined as outlined [here](../resources/planner-order-hint-format.md).|
|assignments|[plannerAssignments](../resources/plannerassignments.md)|The set of users the task is assigned to.|
|bucketId|String|Bucket id to which the task belongs. The bucket needs to be in the plan that the task is in. It is 28 characters long and case-sensitive. [Format validation](../resources/tasks-identifiers-disclaimer.md) is done on the service. |
|conversationThreadId|String|Thread id of the conversation on the task. This is the id of the conversation thread object created in the group.|
|dueDateTime|DateTimeOffset|Date and time at which the task is due. The Timestamp type represents date and time information using ISO 8601 format and is always in UTC time. For example, midnight UTC on Jan 1, 2014 is `2014-01-01T00:00:00Z`|
|orderHint|String|Hint used to order items of this type in a list view. The format is defined as outlined [here](../resources/planner-order-hint-format.md).|
|percentComplete|Int32|Percentage of task completion. When set to `100`, the task is considered completed. |
|planId|String|Plan id to which the task belongs.|
|priority|Int32|Priority of the task. Valid range of values is between `0` and `10` (inclusive), with increasing value being lower priority (`0` has the highest priority and `10` has the lowest priority).  Currently, Planner interprets values `0` and `1` as "urgent", `2` and `3` and `4` as "important", `5`, `6`, and `7` as "medium", and `8`, `9`, and `10` as "low".  Currently, Planner sets the value `1` for "urgent", `3` for "important", `5` for "medium", and `9` for "low".|
|startDateTime|DateTimeOffset|Date and time at which the task starts. The Timestamp type represents date and time information using ISO 8601 format and is always in UTC time. For example, midnight UTC on Jan 1, 2014 is `2014-01-01T00:00:00Z`.|
|title|String|Title of the task.|

## Response

If successful, this method returns a `204 No Content` response code and an empty content. If the request specifies the `Prefer` header with a `return=representation` preference, then this method returns a `200 OK` response code and an updated [plannerTask](../resources/plannertask.md) object in the response body.

This method can return any of the [HTTP status codes](/graph/errors). The most common errors that apps should handle for this method are the 400, 403, 404, 409, and 412 responses. For more information about these errors, see [Common Planner error conditions](../resources/planner-overview.md#common-planner-error-conditions).

 [!IMPORTANT]
 Microsoft Graph SDKs use the v1.0 version of the API by default, and do not support all the types, properties, and APIs available in the beta version. For details about accessing the beta API with the SDK, see [Use the Microsoft Graph SDKs with the beta API](/graph/sdks/use-beta).

 For details about how to [add the SDK](/graph/sdks/sdk-installation) to your project and [create an authProvider](/graph/sdks/choose-authentication-providers) instance, see the [SDK documentation](/graph/sdks/sdks-overview).
