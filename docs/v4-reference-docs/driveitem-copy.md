## Optional query parameters

This method supports the `@microsoft.graph.conflictBehavior` query parameter to customize the behavior when a conflict occurs.

## Request body

In the request body, provide a JSON object with the following parameters.

|:----------------|:-----------------------------------------------|:------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| parentReference | [ItemReference](../resources/itemreference.md) | Optional. Reference to the parent item the copy will be created in.                                         |
| name            | string                                         | Optional. The new name for the copy. If this isn't provided, the same name will be used as the original.    |

**Note:** The _parentReference_ should include the `driveId` and `id` parameters for the target folder.

## Response

Returns details about how to [monitor the progress](/graph/long-running-actions-overview) of the copy, upon accepting the request.

## Example

This example copies a file identified by `{item-id}` into a folder identified with a `driveId` and `id` value.
The new copy of the file will be named `contoso plan (copy).txt`.

### Request

# [HTTP](#tab/http)
<!-- { "blockType": "request", "name": "copy-item", "scopes": "files.readwrite", "target": "action" } -->

```http
POST /me/drive/items/{item-id}/copy
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "parentReference": {
    "driveId": "6F7D00BF-FC4D-4E62-9769-6AEA81F3A21B",
    "id": "DCD0D3AD-8989-4F23-A5A2-2C086050513F"
  },
  "name": "contoso plan (copy).txt"
}
```

# [C#](#tab/csharp)

```csharp

GraphServiceClient graphClient = new GraphServiceClient( authProvider );

var parentReference = new ItemReference
{
	DriveId = "6F7D00BF-FC4D-4E62-9769-6AEA81F3A21B",
	Id = "DCD0D3AD-8989-4F23-A5A2-2C086050513F"
};

var name = "contoso plan (copy).txt";

await graphClient.Me.Drive.Items["{driveItem-id}"]
	.Copy(name,parentReference)
	.Request()
	.PostAsync();

```


 [!IMPORTANT]
 Microsoft Graph SDKs use the v1.0 version of the API by default, and do not support all the types, properties, and APIs available in the beta version. For details about accessing the beta API with the SDK, see [Use the Microsoft Graph SDKs with the beta API](/graph/sdks/use-beta).

 For details about how to [add the SDK](/graph/sdks/sdk-installation) to your project and [create an authProvider](/graph/sdks/choose-authentication-providers) instance, see the [SDK documentation](/graph/sdks/sdks-overview).

### Response
<!-- { "blockType": "response" } -->
```http
HTTP/1.1 202 Accepted
Location: https://contoso.sharepoint.com/_api/v2.0/monitor/4A3407B5-88FC-4504-8B21-0AABD3412717
```
The value of the `Location` header provides a URL for a service that will return the current state of the copy operation.
You can use this information to [determine when the copy has finished](/graph/long-running-actions-overview).

### Remarks

In many cases the copy action is performed asynchronously.
The response from the API will only indicate that the copy operation was accepted or rejected; for example, due to the destination filename already being in use.

[item-resource]: ../resources/driveitem.md
