# event: forward

Namespace: microsoft.graph

> [!IMPORTANT]
> APIs under the `/beta` version in Microsoft Graph are subject to change. Use of these APIs in production applications is not supported. To determine whether an API is available in v1.0, use the **Version** selector.

This action allows the organizer or attendee of a meeting [event](../resources/event.md) to forward the 
meeting request to a new recipient. 

If the meeting event is forwarded from an attendee's Microsoft 365 mailbox to another recipient, this action 
also sends a message to notify the organizer of the forwarding, and adds the recipient to the organizer's 
copy of the meeting event. This convenience is not available when forwarding from an Outlook.com account.

 [!IMPORTANT]
 Microsoft Graph SDKs use the v1.0 version of the API by default, and do not support all the types, properties, and APIs available in the beta version. For details about accessing the beta API with the SDK, see [Use the Microsoft Graph SDKs with the beta API](/graph/sdks/use-beta).

 For details about how to [add the SDK](/graph/sdks/sdk-installation) to your project and [create an authProvider](/graph/sdks/choose-authentication-providers) instance, see the [SDK documentation](/graph/sdks/sdks-overview).
