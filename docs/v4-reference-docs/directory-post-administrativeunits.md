# Create administrativeUnit

Namespace: microsoft.graph

> [!IMPORTANT]
> APIs under the `/beta` version in Microsoft Graph are subject to change. Use of these APIs in production applications is not supported. To determine whether an API is available in v1.0, use the **Version** selector.

Use this API to create a new [administrativeUnit](../resources/administrativeunit.md).
## Permissions
One of the following permissions is required to call this API. To learn more, including how to choose permissions, see [Permissions](/graph/permissions-reference).


|Permission type      | Permissions (from least to most privileged)              |
|:--------------------|:---------------------------------------------------------|
|Delegated (work or school account) | AdministrativeUnit.ReadWrite.All   |
|Delegated (personal Microsoft account) | Not supported.    |
|Application | AdministrativeUnit.ReadWrite.All |

To create an administrative unit, the calling principal must be assigned one of the following [Azure AD roles](/azure/active-directory/roles/permissions-reference):

* Privileged Role Administrator
* Global Administrator

## HTTP request
<!-- { "blockType": "ignored" } -->
```http
POST /administrativeUnits
POST /directory/administrativeUnits
```
## Request headers
| Name      |Description|
|:----------|:----------|
| Authorization  | Bearer {token}. Required. |
| Content-type | application/json. Required. |

## Request body
In the request body, supply a JSON representation of an [administrativeUnit](../resources/administrativeunit.md) object.

You can specify the following properties when creating an **administrativeUnit**.

| Property   | Type |Description|
|:---------------|:--------|:----------|
| description | String | Description for the administrative unit. Optional. |
| displayName | String | Display name for the administrative unit. Required. |
| membershipRule | String | Dynamic membership rule for the administrative unit. For more about the rules that you can use for dynamic administrative units and dynamic groups, see [Using attributes to create advanced rules](https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/articles/active-directory-accessmanagement-groups-with-advanced-rules/). Optional. |
| membershipRuleProcessingState | String | Used to control whether the dynamic membership rule is actively processed. Set to `On` when you want the dynamic membership rule to be active and `Paused` if you want to stop updating membership dynamically. Optional. |
| membershipType | String | Membership type for the administrative unit. Can be `dynamic` or `assigned`. Optional. |
| visibility |String | Visibility for the administrative unit. If not set, then the default is `public`. Can be set to `HiddenMembership`, which hides the membership from non-members. Optional. |

Because the **administrativeUnit** resource supports [extensions](/graph/extensibility-overview), you can use the `POST` operation and add custom properties with your own data to the administrative unit while creating it.

## Response

If successful, this method returns a `201 Created` response code and an [administrativeUnit](../resources/administrativeunit.md) object in the response body.

## Example

### Request

The following is an example of a request that creates a new administrative unit with a dynamic membership rule to include all users whose country is United States.

# [HTTP](#tab/http)
<!-- {
  "blockType": "request",
  "name": "create_administrativeunit_from_administrativeunits"
}-->
```http
POST https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/administrativeUnits
Content-type: application/json

{
    "displayName": "Seattle District Technical Schools",
    "description": "Seattle district technical schools administration",
    "membershipType": "Dynamic",
    "membershipRule": "(user.country -eq \"United States\")",
    "membershipRuleProcessingState": "On"
}
```

# [C#](#tab/csharp)

```csharp

GraphServiceClient graphClient = new GraphServiceClient( authProvider );

var administrativeUnit = new AdministrativeUnit
{
	DisplayName = "Seattle District Technical Schools",
	Description = "Seattle district technical schools administration",
	AdditionalData = new Dictionary<string, object>()
	{
		{"membershipType", "Dynamic"},
		{"membershipRule", "(user.country -eq \"United States\")"},
		{"membershipRuleProcessingState", "On"}
	}
};

await graphClient.AdministrativeUnits
	.Request()
	.AddAsync(administrativeUnit);

```


 [!IMPORTANT]
 Microsoft Graph SDKs use the v1.0 version of the API by default, and do not support all the types, properties, and APIs available in the beta version. For details about accessing the beta API with the SDK, see [Use the Microsoft Graph SDKs with the beta API](/graph/sdks/use-beta).

 For details about how to [add the SDK](/graph/sdks/sdk-installation) to your project and [create an authProvider](/graph/sdks/choose-authentication-providers) instance, see the [SDK documentation](/graph/sdks/sdks-overview).
