# List roleAssignmentScheduleRequests

Namespace: microsoft.graph

> [!IMPORTANT]
> APIs under the `/beta` version in Microsoft Graph are subject to change. Use of these APIs in production applications is not supported. To determine whether an API is available in v1.0, use the **Version** selector.

Retrieve the requests for active role assignments to principals. The active assignments include those made through [assignments and activation requests](rbacapplication-post-roleassignmentschedulerequests.md), and directly through the [role assignments API](../resources/unifiedroleassignment.md). The role assignments can be permanently active with or without an expiry date, or temporarily active after user activation of eligible assignments.
