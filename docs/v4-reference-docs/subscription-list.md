>[!CAUTION]
>Existing apps that use this feature with [baseTask](/graph/api/resources/basetask?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true) or [baseTaskList](/graph/api/resources/basetasklist?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true) should be updated, as the to-do API set built on these resources is deprecated as of May 31, 2022. That API set will stop returning data on August 31, 2022. Please use the API set built on [todoTask](/graph/api/resources/todotask?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true). 
Retrieve a list of webhook subscriptions. 

The content of the response depends on the context in which the app is calling; for details, see the scenarios in the [Permissions](#permissions) section.

## Permissions

Depending on the resource and the permission type (delegated or application) requested, the permission specified in the following table is the least privileged required to call this API. To learn more, including [taking caution](/graph/auth/auth-concepts#best-practices-for-requesting-permissions) before choosing more privileged permissions, search for the following permissions in [Permissions](/graph/permissions-reference).

> **Note**: 
>
> Some resources support change notifications in multiple scenarios, each of which may require different permissions. In those cases, use the resource path to differentiate the scenarios.
>
> Permissions marked with * use [resource-specific consent](/microsoftteams/platform/graph-api/rsc/resource-specific-consent).

Response results are based on the context of the calling app. The following sections describe the common scenarios.

### Basic scenarios

Most commonly, an application wants to retrieve subscriptions that it originally created for the currently signed-in user, or for all users in the directory (work/school accounts). These scenarios do not require any special permissions beyond the ones the app used originally to create its subscriptions.

| Context of the calling app | Response contains |
|:-----|:---------------- |
| App is calling on behalf of the signed-in user (delegated permission). <br/>-and-<br/>App has the original permission required to [create the subscription](subscription-post-subscriptions.md).<br/><br/>**Note:** This applies to both personal Microsoft accounts and work/school accounts. | Subscriptions created by **this app** for the signed-in user only. |
| App is calling on behalf of itself (application permission).<br/>-and-<br/>App has the original permission required to [create the subscription](subscription-post-subscriptions.md).<br/><br/>Note: This applies to work/school accounts only.| Subscriptions created by **this app** for itself or for any user in the directory.|

### Advanced scenarios

In some cases, an app wants to retrieve subscriptions created by other apps. For example, a user wants to see all subscriptions created by any app on their behalf. Or, an administrator may want to see all subscriptions from all apps in their directory.
For such scenarios, a delegated permission Subscription.Read.All is required.

| Context of the calling app | Response contains |
|:-----|:---------------- |
| App is calling on behalf of the signed-in user (delegated permission). *The user is a non-admin*. <br/>-and-<br/>App has the permission Subscription.Read.All<br/><br/>Note: This applies to both personal Microsoft accounts and work/school accounts. | Subscriptions created by **any app** for the signed-in user only. |
| App is calling on behalf of the signed-in user (delegated permission). *The user is an admin*.<br/>-and-<br/>App has the permission Subscription.Read.All<br/><br/>Note: This applies to work/school accounts only. | Subscriptions created by **any app** for **any user** in the directory.|

 [!IMPORTANT]
 Microsoft Graph SDKs use the v1.0 version of the API by default, and do not support all the types, properties, and APIs available in the beta version. For details about accessing the beta API with the SDK, see [Use the Microsoft Graph SDKs with the beta API](/graph/sdks/use-beta).

 For details about how to [add the SDK](/graph/sdks/sdk-installation) to your project and [create an authProvider](/graph/sdks/choose-authentication-providers) instance, see the [SDK documentation](/graph/sdks/sdks-overview).
