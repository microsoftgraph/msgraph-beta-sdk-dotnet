# Create federationConfiguration
Namespace: microsoft.graph

> [!IMPORTANT]
> APIs under the `/beta` version in Microsoft Graph are subject to change. Use of these APIs in production applications is not supported. To determine whether an API is available in v1.0, use the **Version** selector.

Create a new [internalDomainFederation](../resources/internaldomainfederation.md) object.

## Permissions
One of the following permissions is required to call this API. To learn more, including how to choose permissions, see [Permissions](/graph/permissions-reference).

|Permission type|Permissions (from least to most privileged)|
|:---|:---|
|Delegated (work or school account)|Domain.ReadWrite.All|
|Delegated (personal Microsoft account)|Not supported|
|Application|Domain.ReadWrite.All|

The calling user must be assigned one of the following [Azure AD roles](/azure/active-directory/roles/permissions-reference):

- Security Administrator
- External Identity Provider Administrator

## HTTP request

<!-- {
  "blockType": "ignored"
}
-->
``` http
POST /domains/{domainsId}/federationConfiguration
```

## Request headers
|Name|Description|
|:---|:---|
|Authorization|Bearer {token}. Required.|
|Content-Type|application/json. Required.|

## Request body
In the request body, supply a JSON representation of the [internalDomainFederation](../resources/internaldomainfederation.md) object.

You can specify the following properties when creating an **internalDomainFederation**.

|Property|Type|Description|
|:---|:---|:---|
|displayName|String|The display name of the federated identity provider.|
|issuerUri|String|Issuer URI of the federation server.|
|metadataExchangeUri|String|URI of the metadata exchange endpoint used for authentication from rich client applications.|
|signingCertificate|String|Current certificate used to sign tokens passed to the Microsoft identity platform. The certificate is formatted as a Base64 encoded string of the public portion of the federated IdP's token signing certificate and must be compatible with the X509Certificate2 class. <br>This property is used in the following scenarios: <li> If a rollover is required outside of the autorollover update <li> A new federation service is being set up <li> If the new token signing certificate isn't present in the federation properties after the federation service certificate has been updated.<br>Azure AD updates certificates via an autorollover process in which it attempts to retrieve a new certificate from the federation service metadata, 30 days before expiry of the current certificate. If a new certificate isn't available, Azure AD monitors the metadata daily and will update the federation settings for the domain when a new certificate is available.|
|passiveSignInUri|String|URI that web-based clients are directed to when signing in to Azure AD services.|
|preferredAuthenticationProtocol|authenticationProtocol|Preferred authentication protocol. The possible values are: `wsFed`, `saml`, `unknownFutureValue`.|
|activeSignInUri|String|URL of the endpoint used by active clients when authenticating with federated domains set up for single sign-on in Azure Active Directory (Azure AD). Corresponds to the **ActiveLogOnUri** property of the [Set-MsolDomainFederationSettings MSOnline v1 PowerShell cmdlet](/powershell/module/msonline/set-msoldomainfederationsettings).|
|signOutUri|String|URI that clients are redirected to when they sign out of Azure AD services. Corresponds to the **LogOffUri** property of the [Set-MsolDomainFederationSettings MSOnline v1 PowerShell cmdlet](/powershell/module/msonline/set-msoldomainfederationsettings).|
|promptLoginBehavior|promptLoginBehavior|Sets the preferred behavior for the sign-in prompt. The possible values are: `translateToFreshPasswordAuthentication`, `nativeSupport`, `disabled`, `unknownFutureValue`.|
|isSignedAuthenticationRequestRequired|Boolean|If true, when SAML authentication requests are sent to the federated SAML IDP, Azure AD will sign those requests using the OrgID signing key. If false (default), the SAML authentication requests sent to the federated IDP are not signed.|
|nextSigningCertificate|String|Fallback token signing certificate that is used to sign tokens when the primary signing certificate expires. Formatted as Base64 encoded strings of the public portion of the federated IdP's token signing certificate. Needs to be compatible with the X509Certificate2 class. Much like the **signingCertificate**, the **nextSigningCertificate** property is used if a rollover is required outside of the auto-rollover update, a new federation service is being set up, or if the new token signing certificate is not present in the federation properties after the federation service certificate has been updated.|
|signingCertificateUpdateStatus|[signingCertificateUpdateStatus](../resources/signingcertificateupdatestatus.md)|Provides status and timestamp of the last update of the signing certificate.|
|federatedIdpMfaBehavior|federatedIdpMfaBehavior|Determines whether Azure AD accepts the MFA performed by the federated IdP when a federated user accesses an application that is governed by a conditional access policy that requires MFA. The possible values are: `acceptIfMfaDoneByFederatedIdp`, `enforceMfaByFederatedIdp`, `rejectMfaByFederatedIdp`, `unknownFutureValue`. For more information, see [federatedIdpMfaBehavior values](#federatedidpmfabehavior-values).|

### federatedIdpMfaBehavior values

| Member | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| acceptIfMfaDoneByFederatedIdp | Azure AD accepts MFA that's performed by the federated identity provider. If the federated identity provider didn't perform MFA, Azure AD performs the MFA. |
| enforceMfaByFederatedIdp | Azure AD accepts MFA that's performed by federated identity provider. If the federated identity provider didn't perform MFA, it redirects the request to federated identity provider to perform MFA. |
| rejectMfaByFederatedIdp | Azure AD always performs MFA and rejects MFA that's performed by the federated identity provider. |

**Note:** **federatedIdpMfaBehavior** is an evolved version of the **SupportsMfa** property of the [Set-MsolDomainFederationSettings MSOnline v1 PowerShell cmdlet](/powershell/module/msonline/set-msoldomainfederationsettings). 
+ Switching between **federatedIdpMfaBehavior** and **SupportsMfa** is not supported.
+ Once **federatedIdpMfaBehavior** property is set, Azure AD ignores the **SupportsMfa** setting.
+ If the **federatedIdpMfaBehavior** property is never set, Azure AD will continue to honor the **SupportsMfa** setting.
+ If neither **federatedIdpMfaBehavior** nor **SupportsMfa** is set, Azure AD will default to `acceptIfMfaDoneByFederatedIdp` behavior.


## Response

If successful, this method returns a `201 Created` response code and an [internalDomainFederation](../resources/internaldomainfederation.md) object in the response body.

 [!IMPORTANT]
 Microsoft Graph SDKs use the v1.0 version of the API by default, and do not support all the types, properties, and APIs available in the beta version. For details about accessing the beta API with the SDK, see [Use the Microsoft Graph SDKs with the beta API](/graph/sdks/use-beta).

 For details about how to [add the SDK](/graph/sdks/sdk-installation) to your project and [create an authProvider](/graph/sdks/choose-authentication-providers) instance, see the [SDK documentation](/graph/sdks/sdks-overview).
