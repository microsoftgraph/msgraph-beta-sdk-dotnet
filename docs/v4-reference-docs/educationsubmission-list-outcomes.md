# List outcomes

Namespace: microsoft.graph

> [!IMPORTANT]
> APIs under the `/beta` version in Microsoft Graph are subject to change. Use of these APIs in production applications is not supported. To determine whether an API is available in v1.0, use the **Version** selector.

Retrieve a list of [educationOutcome](../resources/educationoutcome.md) objects.  There are four types of outcomes: **educationPointsOutcome**, **educationFeedbackOutcome**, **educationRubricOutcome**, and **educationFeedbackResourceOutcome**. Only teachers, students, and applications with application permissions can perform this operation.

A submission for a credit assignment (one that has no point value and no rubric) will have an [educationFeedbackOutcome](../resources/educationpointsoutcome.md). (It might also return an [educationPointsOutcome](../resources/educationpointsoutcome.md), but that outcome is ignored.)

A submission for a points assignment (one that has a point value assigned) will have both an [educationFeedbackOutcome](../resources/educationpointsoutcome.md) and an [educationPointsOutcome](../resources/educationpointsoutcome.md).

A submission for an assignment with an attached rubric, if the rubric is a credit rubric (no points), will have an [educationFeedbackOutcome](../resources/educationpointsoutcome.md) and an [educationRubricOutcome](../resources/educationrubricoutcome.md). (It might also return an [educationPointsOutcome](../resources/educationpointsoutcome.md), but that outcome is ignored.)

A submission for an assignment with an attached rubric, if the rubric is a points rubric, will have an [educationFeedbackOutcome](../resources/educationpointsoutcome.md), an [educationPointsOutcome](../resources/educationpointsoutcome.md), and an [educationRubricOutcome](../resources/educationrubricoutcome.md).

A submission for a feedback resource will have an [educationFeedbackResourceOutcome](../resources/educationfeedbackresourceoutcome.md).

All outcome types have a regular and a published property appropriate to that type of outcome; for example, **points** and **publishedPoints**, **feedback** and **publishedFeedback**. The regular property is the most recent value updated by the teacher; the published property is the most recent value returned to the student.

## Permissions

| Delegated (personal Microsoft account) | Not supported. |
| Application                            | EduAssignments.ReadBasic.All, EduAssignments.ReadWriteBasic.All, EduAssignments.Read.All, EduAssignments.ReadWrite.All |

## HTTP request

<!-- { "blockType": "ignored" } -->

```http
GET /education/classes/{classId}/assignments/{assignmentId}/submissions/{submissionId}/outcomes
```

## Optional query parameters

## Response

If successful, this method returns a `200 OK` response code and a collection of [educationOutcome](../resources/educationoutcome.md) objects in the response body.

## Examples

### Example 1: Get all outcomes

The following example shows how to retrieve all outcomes.

#### Request

The following is an example of the request.

# [HTTP](#tab/http)
<!-- {
  "blockType": "request",
  "name": "get_outcomes"
}-->

```msgraph-interactive
GET https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/education/classes/{id}/assignments/{id}/submissions/{id}/outcomes
```

# [C#](#tab/csharp)

```csharp

GraphServiceClient graphClient = new GraphServiceClient( authProvider );

var outcomes = await graphClient.Education.Classes["{educationClass-id}"].Assignments["{educationAssignment-id}"].Submissions["{educationSubmission-id}"].Outcomes
	.Request()
	.GetAsync();

```


 [!IMPORTANT]
 Microsoft Graph SDKs use the v1.0 version of the API by default, and do not support all the types, properties, and APIs available in the beta version. For details about accessing the beta API with the SDK, see [Use the Microsoft Graph SDKs with the beta API](/graph/sdks/use-beta).

 For details about how to [add the SDK](/graph/sdks/sdk-installation) to your project and [create an authProvider](/graph/sdks/choose-authentication-providers) instance, see the [SDK documentation](/graph/sdks/sdks-overview).

#### Response
