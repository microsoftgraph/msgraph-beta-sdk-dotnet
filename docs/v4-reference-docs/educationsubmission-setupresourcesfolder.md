Trigger the creation of the SharePoint resource folder where all file-based resources (Word, Excel, and so on) should be uploaded for a given submission. Only teachers and students can perform this operation.

Note that files must be located in this folder in order to be added as resources. Only a student in the class can determine what files to upload in a given submission-level resource folder.
