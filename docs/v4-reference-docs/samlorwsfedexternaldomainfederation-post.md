## HTTP request

<!-- {
  "blockType": "ignored"
}

``` http
POST /directory/federationConfigurations/microsoft.graph.samlOrWsFedExternalDomainFederation
```

## Request headers

|Name|Description|
|:---|:---|
|Authorization|Bearer {token}. Required.|
|Content-Type|application/json. Required.|

## Request body

In the request body, supply a JSON representation of the [samlOrWsFedExternalDomainFederation](../resources/samlorwsfedexternaldomainfederation.md) object.

The following table shows the properties that are required when you create the [samlOrWsFedExternalDomainFederation](../resources/samlorwsfedexternaldomainfederation.md).

|Property|Type|Description|
|:---|:---|:---|
|displayName|String|The display name of the SAML/WS-Fed based identity provider. Inherited from [identityProviderBase](../resources/identityproviderbase.md).|
|issuerUri|String|Issuer URI of the federation server. Inherited from [samlOrWsFedProvider](../resources/samlorwsfedprovider.md).|
|metadataExchangeUri|String|URI of the metadata exchange endpoint used for authentication from rich client applications. Inherited from [samlOrWsFedProvider](../resources/samlorwsfedprovider.md).|
|passiveSignInUri|String|URI that web-based clients are directed to when signing in to Azure AD services. Inherited from [samlOrWsFedProvider](../resources/samlorwsfedprovider.md).|
|preferredAuthenticationProtocol|String|Preferred authentication protocol. Supported values include `saml` or `wsfed`. Inherited from [samlOrWsFedProvider](../resources/samlorwsfedprovider.md).|
|signingCertificate|String|Current certificate used to sign tokens passed to the Microsoft identity platform. The certificate is formatted as a Base64 encoded string of the public portion of the federated IdP's token signing certificate and must be compatible with the X509Certificate2 class.  <br/><br/> This property is used in the following scenarios: <ul><li> if a rollover is required outside of the autorollover update <li>a new federation service is being set up <li> if the new token signing certificate isn't present in the federation properties after the federation service certificate has been updated. </ul> <br/><br/> Azure AD updates certificates via an autorollover process in which it attempts to retrieve a new certificate from the federation service metadata, 30 days before expiry of the current certificate. If a new certificate isn't available, Azure AD monitors the metadata daily and will update the federation settings for the domain when a new certificate is available.|

## Response

If successful, this method returns a `201 Created` response code and a [samlOrWsFedExternalDomainFederation](../resources/samlorwsfedexternaldomainfederation.md) object in the response body.
