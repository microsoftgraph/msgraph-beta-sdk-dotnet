# Update event

Namespace: microsoft.graph

> [!IMPORTANT]
> APIs under the `/beta` version in Microsoft Graph are subject to change. Use of these APIs in production applications is not supported. To determine whether an API is available in v1.0, use the **Version** selector.

Update the properties of the [event](../resources/event.md) object.

### Notes for updating specific properties
Note the following behaviors or recommendations when updating the corresponding properties:

- **attendees** property and meeting updates
  - An event update that includes only the **attendees** property in the request body sends a meeting update to only the attendees that have changed.
  - An event update that removes an attendee specified as a member of a distribution list sends a meeting update to all the attendees.

- **body** property and online meetings

  Before updating the body of an event that has been set up as an online meeting, be sure to first get the **body** property, apply the appropriate changes to the content, and preserve the meeting blob for online meeting. Inadvertently removing the meeting blob from the body would disable meeting online. 

- **end** and **start** properties and their time zones
  
  When updating the time zone of the start or end time of an event, first [find the supported time zones](outlookuser-supportedtimezones.md) to make sure you set only time zones that have been configured for the user's mailbox server. 

## Permissions

## Request headers
| Name       | Type | Description|
|:-----------|:------|:----------|
| Authorization  | string  | Bearer {token}. Required. |

## Request body
In the request body, supply the values for relevant fields that should be updated. Existing properties that are not included in the request body will maintain their previous values or be recalculated based on changes to other property values. For best performance you shouldn't include existing values that haven't changed.

| Property	     | Type	   | Description |
|:---------------|:--------|:------------|
| attendees|Attendee|The collection of attendees for the event. See additional [notes for updating specific properties](#notes-for-updating-specific-properties).|
| body|ItemBody|The body of the message associated with the event. See additional [notes for updating specific properties](#notes-for-updating-specific-properties).|
| categories|String collection|The categories associated with the event.|
| end|DateTimeTimeZone|The date, time, and time zone that the event ends. See additional [notes for updating specific properties](#notes-for-updating-specific-properties). |
|hideAttendees|Boolean|When set to `true`, each attendee only sees themselves in the meeting request and meeting **Tracking** list. Default is false.|
| importance|String|The importance of the event. Possible values are: `low`, `normal`, `high`.|
| isAllDay|Boolean|Set to true if the event lasts all day. If true, regardless of whether it's a single-day or multi-day event, start and end time must be set to midnight and be in the same time zone.|
|isOnlineMeeting|Boolean| `True` if this event has online meeting information, `false` otherwise. Default is false. Optional.|
| isReminderOn|Boolean|Set to true if an alert is set to remind the user of the event.|
| location|Location|The location of the event.|
|locations|[Location](../resources/location.md) collection|The locations where the event is held or attended from. The **location** and **locations** properties always correspond with each other. If you update the **location** property, any prior locations in the **locations** collection would be removed and replaced by the new **location** value. |
|onlineMeetingProvider|onlineMeetingProviderType| Represents the online meeting service provider. The possible values are `teamsForBusiness`, `skypeForBusiness`, and `skypeForConsumer`. Optional. |
| recurrence|PatternedRecurrence|The recurrence pattern for the event.|
| reminderMinutesBeforeStart|Int32|The number of minutes before the event start time that the reminder alert occurs.|
| responseRequested|Boolean|Set to true if the sender would like a response when the event is accepted or declined.|
| sensitivity|String| Possible values are: `normal`, `personal`, `private`, `confidential`.|
| showAs|String|The status to show. Possible values are: `free` , `tentative`, `busy`, `oof`, `workingElsewhere`, `unknown`.|
| start|DateTimeTimeZone|The start date, time, and time zone of the event. See additional [notes for updating specific properties](#notes-for-updating-specific-properties). |
| subject|String|The text of the event's subject line.|

Because the **event** resource supports [extensions](/graph/extensibility-overview), you can use the `PATCH` operation to
add, update, or delete your own app-specific data in custom properties of an extension in an existing **event** instance.

If the **event** you're updating is the master event of a recurring series, contains multiple attendees, and has instances that have been updated separately, multiple notification emails will be sent out: one for the master series and one per instance that has been updated.

## Response

If successful, this method returns a `200 OK` response code and updated [event](../resources/event.md) object in the response body.

>**Note:** This method can return an HTTP 400 Bad Request response with an error code of `ErrorOccurrenceCrossingBoundary` and the following error message: Modified occurrence is crossing or overlapping adjacent occurrence. This indicates that the update violates the following Outlook restriction on recurrence exceptions: an occurrence cannot be moved to or before the day of the previous occurrence, and cannot be moved to or after the day of the following occurrence.

 [!IMPORTANT]
 Microsoft Graph SDKs use the v1.0 version of the API by default, and do not support all the types, properties, and APIs available in the beta version. For details about accessing the beta API with the SDK, see [Use the Microsoft Graph SDKs with the beta API](/graph/sdks/use-beta).

 For details about how to [add the SDK](/graph/sdks/sdk-installation) to your project and [create an authProvider](/graph/sdks/choose-authentication-providers) instance, see the [SDK documentation](/graph/sdks/sdks-overview).
