# workflow: restore (a deleted workflow)

Namespace: microsoft.graph.identityGovernance

> [!IMPORTANT]
> APIs under the `/beta` version in Microsoft Graph are subject to change. Use of these APIs in production applications is not supported. To determine whether an API is available in v1.0, use the **Version** selector.

Restore a workflow that has been deleted. You can only restore a workflow that was deleted within the last 30 days before Azure AD automatically permanently deletes it.

## Permissions

One of the following permissions is required to call this API. To learn more, including how to choose permissions, see [Permissions](/graph/permissions-reference).

|Permission type|Permissions (from least to most privileged)|
|:---|:---|
|Delegated (work or school account)|LifecycleWorkflows.Read.All, LifecycleWorkflows.ReadWrite.All|
|Delegated (personal Microsoft account)|Not supported.|
|Application|LifecycleWorkflows.Read.All, LifecycleWorkflows.ReadWrite.All|

For delegated scenarios, the admin needs one of the following [Azure AD roles](/azure/active-directory/users-groups-roles/directory-assign-admin-roles#available-roles):

- Global administrator
- Lifecycle workflows administrator

 [!IMPORTANT]
 Microsoft Graph SDKs use the v1.0 version of the API by default, and do not support all the types, properties, and APIs available in the beta version. For details about accessing the beta API with the SDK, see [Use the Microsoft Graph SDKs with the beta API](/graph/sdks/use-beta).

 For details about how to [add the SDK](/graph/sdks/sdk-installation) to your project and [create an authProvider](/graph/sdks/choose-authentication-providers) instance, see the [SDK documentation](/graph/sdks/sdks-overview).
