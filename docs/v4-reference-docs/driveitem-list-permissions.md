# List sharing permissions on a driveItem

Namespace: microsoft.graph

> [!IMPORTANT]
> APIs under the `/beta` version in Microsoft Graph are subject to change. Use of these APIs in production applications is not supported. To determine whether an API is available in v1.0, use the **Version** selector.

List the effective sharing permissions on a [driveItem](../resources/driveitem.md).

## Access to sharing permissions

The permissions collection includes potentially sensitive information and may not be available for every caller.

* For the owner of the item, all sharing permissions will be returned. This includes co-owners.
* For a non-owner caller, only the sharing permissions that apply to the caller are returned.
* Sharing permission properties that contain secrets (e.g. `shareId` and `webUrl`) are only returned for callers that are able to create the sharing permission.

## Permissions

One of the following permissions is required to call this API. To learn more, including how to choose permissions, see [Permissions](/graph/permissions-reference).

|Permission type      | Permissions (from least to most privileged)              |
|:--------------------|:---------------------------------------------------------|
|Delegated (work or school account) | Files.Read, Files.ReadWrite, Files.Read.All, Files.ReadWrite.All, Sites.Read.All, Sites.ReadWrite.All    |
|Delegated (personal Microsoft account) | Files.Read, Files.ReadWrite, Files.Read.All, Files.ReadWrite.All    |
|Application | Files.Read.All, Files.ReadWrite.All, Sites.Read.All, Sites.ReadWrite.All |

## HTTP request

<!-- { "blockType": "ignored" } -->

```http
GET /drives/{drive-id}/items/{item-id}/permissions
GET /groups/{group-id}/drive/items/{item-id}/permissions
GET /me/drive/items/{item-id}/permissions
GET /me/drive/root:/{path}:/permissions
GET /sites/{siteId}/drive/items/{itemId}/permissions
GET /users/{userId}/drive/items/{itemId}/permissions
```

## Optional query parameters

This method supports the `$select` [OData Query Parameters](/graph/query-parameters) to customize the response.

## Optional request headers

| Name          | Type   | Description                                                                                                                                     |
|:--------------|:-------|:------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| if-none-match | string | If this request header is included and the etag provided matches the current etag on the item, an `HTTP 304 Not Modified` response is returned. |

## Response

If successful, this method returns a `200 OK` response code and collection of [Permission](../resources/permission.md) resources in the response body.

Effective sharing permissions of a DriveItem can come from two sources:

* Sharing permissions applied directly on the DriveItem itself
* Sharing permissions inherited from the DriveItem's ancestors

Callers can differentiate if the permission is inherited or not by checking the **inheritedFrom** property.
This property is an [**itemReference**](../resources/itemreference.md) resource referencing the ancestor that the permission is inherited from.

## Example

This example retrieves the collection of permissions on an item in the signed in user's drive.


# [HTTP](#tab/http)
<!-- { "blockType": "request", "name": "get-item-permissions", "scopes": "files.read" } -->

```msgraph-interactive
GET /me/drive/items/{item-id}/permissions
```

# [C#](#tab/csharp)

```csharp

GraphServiceClient graphClient = new GraphServiceClient( authProvider );

var permissions = await graphClient.Me.Drive.Items["{driveItem-id}"].Permissions
	.Request()
	.GetAsync();

```


 [!IMPORTANT]
 Microsoft Graph SDKs use the v1.0 version of the API by default, and do not support all the types, properties, and APIs available in the beta version. For details about accessing the beta API with the SDK, see [Use the Microsoft Graph SDKs with the beta API](/graph/sdks/use-beta).

 For details about how to [add the SDK](/graph/sdks/sdk-installation) to your project and [create an authProvider](/graph/sdks/choose-authentication-providers) instance, see the [SDK documentation](/graph/sdks/sdks-overview).

### Response

This example response includes three permissions, the first is a sharing link with edit permissions, the second is an explicit permission for a user named John, which was inherited from a parent folder, and the third is a read-write sharing link created by an application.

```

## Remarks

The **permissions** relationship of DriveItem cannot be expanded as part of a call to [get DriveItem](driveitem-get.md) or a collection of DriveItems.
You must access the permissions property directly.
