# Grant an appRoleAssignment to a service principal

Namespace: microsoft.graph

> [!IMPORTANT]
> APIs under the `/beta` version in Microsoft Graph are subject to change. Use of these APIs in production applications is not supported. To determine whether an API is available in v1.0, use the **Version** selector.

Assign an app role to a client service principal.

App roles that are assigned to service principals are also known as [application permissions](/azure/active-directory/develop/v2-permissions-and-consent#permission-types). Application permissions can be granted directly with app role assignments, or through a [consent experience](/azure/active-directory/develop/application-consent-experience).

To grant an app role assignment to a client service principal, you need three identifiers:

- `principalId`: The `id` of the client service principal to which you are assigning the app role.
- `resourceId`: The `id` of the resource `servicePrincipal` (the API) which has defined the app role (the application permission).
- `appRoleId`: The `id` of the `appRole` (defined on the resource service principal) to assign to the client service principal.

## Permissions

One of the following permissions is required to call this API. To learn more, including how to choose permissions, see [Permissions](/graph/permissions-reference).

|Permission type      | Permissions (from least to most privileged)              |
|:--------------------|:---------------------------------------------------------|
|Delegated (work or school account) | AppRoleAssignment.ReadWrite.All and Application.Read.All, AppRoleAssignment.ReadWrite.All and Directory.Read.All |
|Delegated (personal Microsoft account) | Not supported.    |
|Application | AppRoleAssignment.ReadWrite.All and Application.Read.All, AppRoleAssignment.ReadWrite.All and Directory.Read.All |

## HTTP request

You can address the service principal using either its **id** or **appId**. **id** and **appId** are referred to as the **Object ID** and **Application (Client) ID**, respectively, in the Azure portal.
<!-- { "blockType": "ignored" } -->
```http
POST /servicePrincipals/{id}/appRoleAssignments
POST /servicePrincipals(appId='{appId}')/appRoleAssignments

```

> [!NOTE]
> As a best practice, we recommend creating app role assignments through the [`appRoleAssignedTo` relationship of the _resource_ service principal](serviceprincipal-post-approleassignedto.md), instead of the `appRoleAssignments` relationship of the assigned user, group, or service principal.

## Request headers

| Name       | Description|
|:-----------|:----------|
| Authorization | Bearer {token}. Required.  |
| Content-type | application/json. Required. |

## Request body

In the request body, supply a JSON representation of an [appRoleAssignment](../resources/approleassignment.md) object.

## Response

If successful, this method returns a `201 Created` response code and an [appRoleAssignment](../resources/approleassignment.md) object in the response body.

## Examples

### Request

Here is an example of the request.


# [HTTP](#tab/http)
<!-- {
  "blockType": "request",
  "name": "serviceprincipal_create_approleassignment"
}-->

```http
POST https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/servicePrincipals/9028d19c-26a9-4809-8e3f-20ff73e2d75e/appRoleAssignments
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "principalId": "9028d19c-26a9-4809-8e3f-20ff73e2d75e",

  "appRoleId": "498476ce-e0fe-48b0-b801-37ba7e2685c6"
}
```

# [C#](#tab/csharp)

```csharp

GraphServiceClient graphClient = new GraphServiceClient( authProvider );

var appRoleAssignment = new AppRoleAssignment
{
	PrincipalId = Guid.Parse("9028d19c-26a9-4809-8e3f-20ff73e2d75e"),
	ResourceId = Guid.Parse("8fce32da-1246-437b-99cd-76d1d4677bd5"),
	AppRoleId = Guid.Parse("498476ce-e0fe-48b0-b801-37ba7e2685c6")
};

await graphClient.ServicePrincipals["{servicePrincipal-id}"].AppRoleAssignments
	.Request()
	.AddAsync(appRoleAssignment);

```


 [!IMPORTANT]
 Microsoft Graph SDKs use the v1.0 version of the API by default, and do not support all the types, properties, and APIs available in the beta version. For details about accessing the beta API with the SDK, see [Use the Microsoft Graph SDKs with the beta API](/graph/sdks/use-beta).

 For details about how to [add the SDK](/graph/sdks/sdk-installation) to your project and [create an authProvider](/graph/sdks/choose-authentication-providers) instance, see the [SDK documentation](/graph/sdks/sdks-overview).
