# presence: setPresence

Namespace: microsoft.graph

> [!IMPORTANT]
> APIs under the `/beta` version in Microsoft Graph are subject to change. Use of these APIs in production applications is not supported. To determine whether an API is available in v1.0, use the **Version** selector.

Set the availability and activity status in a presence session of an application for a user.

### Presence sessions
A user can have multiple presence sessions because the user can be on multiple Teams clients (desktop, mobile, and web). Each Teams client has an independent presence session and the user's presence is an aggregated state from all the sessions behind.

Similarly, an application can have its own presence session for a user and be able to update the state.

The following is the precedence for how session states are aggregated, with "A > B" representing A having precedence over B:
* User-preferred state > session-level states (user-preferred state overrides session-level states)
* Among session-level states: DoNotDisturb > Busy > Available > Away

> **Note:** When a user presence changes in Microsoft Graph, because the Teams client uses poll mode, it will take a few minutes to update the presence status.

### Timeout, expiration, and keep alive
A presence session may **time out** and **expire**, so the application needs to call this API before the **timeout**, to maintain the state for the session; or before the **expiration**, to keep the session alive.

A presence session can time out if the availability is `Available` and the timeout is 5 minutes. When it times out, the presence state fades in stages. For example, if an application sets the presence session as `Available/Available`, the state would change to `Available/AvailableInactive` in 5 minutes with the first timeout, then `Away/Away` in another 5 minutes with the second timeout.

The expiration of a presence session is configurable with the `expirationDuration` parameter. When a session expires it becomes `Offline`.

## Permissions
The following permission is required to call the API. To learn more, including how to choose permissions, see [Permissions](/graph/permissions-reference).

| Permission type                        | Permissions (from least to most privileged) |
| :------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------ |
| Delegated (work or school account)     | Presence.ReadWrite                          |
| Delegated (personal Microsoft account) | Not Supported.                              |
| Application                            | Presence.ReadWrite.All                      |

 [!IMPORTANT]
 Microsoft Graph SDKs use the v1.0 version of the API by default, and do not support all the types, properties, and APIs available in the beta version. For details about accessing the beta API with the SDK, see [Use the Microsoft Graph SDKs with the beta API](/graph/sdks/use-beta).

 For details about how to [add the SDK](/graph/sdks/sdk-installation) to your project and [create an authProvider](/graph/sdks/choose-authentication-providers) instance, see the [SDK documentation](/graph/sdks/sdks-overview).
