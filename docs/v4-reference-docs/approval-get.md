# Get approval

Namespace: microsoft.graph

> [!IMPORTANT]
> APIs under the `/beta` version in Microsoft Graph are subject to change. Use of these APIs in production applications is not supported. To determine whether an API is available in v1.0, use the **Version** selector.

In [Azure AD entitlement management](../resources/entitlementmanagement-overview.md), retrieves the properties of an [approval](../resources/approval.md) object.  This call can be made by an approver, providing the identifier of the [access package assignment request](../resources/accesspackageassignmentrequest.md).

## Permissions

One of the following permissions is required to call this API. To learn more, including how to choose permissions, see [Permissions](/graph/permissions-reference).

| Permission type                        | Permissions (from least to most privileged) |
|:---------------------------------------|:--------------------------------------------|
| Delegated (work or school account)     | EntitlementManagement.Read.All, EntitlementManagement.ReadWrite.All |
| Delegated (personal Microsoft account) | Not supported. |
| Application                            | Not supported. |

## HTTP request

<!-- { "blockType": "ignored" } -->

```http
GET /identityGovernance/entitlementManagement/accessPackageAssignmentApprovals/{id}
```

## Request headers

| Name      |Description|
|:----------|:----------|
| Authorization | Bearer \{token\}. Required. |

## Request body

Do not supply a request body for this method.

## Response

If successful, this method returns a `200 OK` response code and the requested [approval](../resources/approval.md) object in the response body. However, if the caller does not have the right permissions, the method returns a `403 Forbidden` response code.

## Examples

### Request

The following is an example of the request.


# [HTTP](#tab/http)
<!-- {
  "blockType": "request",
  "name": "get_approval"
}-->

```msgraph-interactive
GET https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/identityGovernance/entitlementManagement/accessPackageAssignmentApprovals/abd306ef-f7b2-4a10-9fd1-493454322489
```

# [C#](#tab/csharp)

```csharp

GraphServiceClient graphClient = new GraphServiceClient( authProvider );

var approval = await graphClient.IdentityGovernance.EntitlementManagement.AccessPackageAssignmentApprovals["{approval-id}"]
	.Request()
	.GetAsync();

```


 [!IMPORTANT]
 Microsoft Graph SDKs use the v1.0 version of the API by default, and do not support all the types, properties, and APIs available in the beta version. For details about accessing the beta API with the SDK, see [Use the Microsoft Graph SDKs with the beta API](/graph/sdks/use-beta).

 For details about how to [add the SDK](/graph/sdks/sdk-installation) to your project and [create an authProvider](/graph/sdks/choose-authentication-providers) instance, see the [SDK documentation](/graph/sdks/sdks-overview).
