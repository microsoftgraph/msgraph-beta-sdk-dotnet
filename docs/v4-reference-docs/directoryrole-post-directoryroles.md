Activate a directory role. To read a directory role or update its members, it must first be activated in the tenant.

The Company Administrators and the implicit user directory roles (**User**, **Guest User**, and **Restricted Guest User** roles) are activated by default. To access and assign members to other directory roles, you must first activate it with its corresponding [directory role template](../resources/directoryroletemplate.md) ID.

 [!IMPORTANT]
 Microsoft Graph SDKs use the v1.0 version of the API by default, and do not support all the types, properties, and APIs available in the beta version. For details about accessing the beta API with the SDK, see [Use the Microsoft Graph SDKs with the beta API](/graph/sdks/use-beta).

 For details about how to [add the SDK](/graph/sdks/sdk-installation) to your project and [create an authProvider](/graph/sdks/choose-authentication-providers) instance, see the [SDK documentation](/graph/sdks/sdks-overview).
