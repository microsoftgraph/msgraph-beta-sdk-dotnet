# List schemaExtensions

Namespace: microsoft.graph

> [!IMPORTANT]
> APIs under the `/beta` version in Microsoft Graph are subject to change. Use of these APIs in production applications is not supported. To determine whether an API is available in v1.0, use the **Version** selector.

Get a list of [schemaExtension](../resources/schemaextension.md) objects in your tenant. The schema extensions can be `InDevelopment`, `Available`, or `Deprecated` and includes schema extensions:
+ Created by any apps you own in the current tenant.
+ Owned by other apps that are marked as `Available`.
+ Created by other developers from other tenants and marked as `Available`. This is different from other APIs that only return tenant-specific data. Extension data created based on schema extension definitions is tenant-specific and can only be accessed by apps explicitly granted permission. 

## Permissions
One of the following permissions is required to call this API. To learn more, including how to choose permissions, see [Permissions](/graph/permissions-reference).


|Permission type      | Permissions (from least to most privileged)              |
|:--------------------|:---------------------------------------------------------|
|Delegated (work or school account) | User.Read, Application.Read.All   |
|Delegated (personal Microsoft account) | Not supported.    |
|Application | Application.Read.All  |

## HTTP request
<!-- { "blockType": "ignored" } -->
```http
GET /schemaExtensions
```
## Optional query parameters
This method supports the `$filter` (`eq`) and `$top` [OData query parameters](/graph/query-parameters) to help customize the response.

## Request headers
| Name      |Description|
|:----------|:----------|
| Authorization  | Bearer {token}. Required. |
| Content-Type   | application/json |

## Request body
Do not supply a request body for this method.

## Response

If successful, this method returns a `200 OK` response code and collection of [schemaExtension](../resources/schemaextension.md) objects in the response body.
## Example
### Request
The following example shows how to look among all the accessible extensions for a specific one by filtering on its unique **id**. 

# [HTTP](#tab/http)
<!-- {
  "blockType": "request",
  "name": "get_schemaextensions"
}-->
```msgraph-interactive
GET https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/schemaExtensions?$filter=id%20eq%20'graphlearn_test'
```

# [C#](#tab/csharp)

```csharp

GraphServiceClient graphClient = new GraphServiceClient( authProvider );

var schemaExtensions = await graphClient.SchemaExtensions
	.Request()
	.Filter("id eq 'graphlearn_test'")
	.GetAsync();

```


 [!IMPORTANT]
 Microsoft Graph SDKs use the v1.0 version of the API by default, and do not support all the types, properties, and APIs available in the beta version. For details about accessing the beta API with the SDK, see [Use the Microsoft Graph SDKs with the beta API](/graph/sdks/use-beta).

 For details about how to [add the SDK](/graph/sdks/sdk-installation) to your project and [create an authProvider](/graph/sdks/choose-authentication-providers) instance, see the [SDK documentation](/graph/sdks/sdks-overview).

### Response
The following is an example of the response.
