In the request URL, provide the following parameters with a valid value.

| Parameter | Type   | Description                              |

| period    | string | Specifies the length of time over which the report is aggregated. The supported values for {period_value} are: `D7`, `D30`, `D90`, and `D180`. These values follow the format D*n* where *n* represents the number of days over which the report is aggregated. Required. |
| date      | Date   | Specifies the date for which you would like to view details about activities across teams. {date_value} must have a format of YYYY-MM-DD. As this report is only available for the past 30 days, {date_value} should be a date from that range. |

- Active users
- Active Channels
- Guests
- Reactions
- Meetings Organized
- Post Messages
