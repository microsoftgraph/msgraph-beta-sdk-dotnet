# Search for sites

Search across a SharePoint tenant for [sites][] that match keywords provided.

The only property that works for sorting is **createdDateTime**. The search filter is a free text search that uses multiple properties when retrieving the search results.

[sites]: ../resources/site.md

|Delegated (personal Microsoft account) | Not supported.

GraphServiceClient graphClient = new GraphServiceClient( authProvider );

 [!IMPORTANT]
 Microsoft Graph SDKs use the v1.0 version of the API by default, and do not support all the types, properties, and APIs available in the beta version. For details about accessing the beta API with the SDK, see [Use the Microsoft Graph SDKs with the beta API](/graph/sdks/use-beta).

 For details about how to [add the SDK](/graph/sdks/sdk-installation) to your project and [create an authProvider](/graph/sdks/choose-authentication-providers) instance, see the [SDK documentation](/graph/sdks/sdks-overview).
