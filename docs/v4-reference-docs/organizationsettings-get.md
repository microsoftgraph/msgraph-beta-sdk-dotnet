# Get organizationSettings

Namespace: microsoft.graph

> [!IMPORTANT]
> APIs under the `/beta` version in Microsoft Graph are subject to change. Use of these APIs in production applications is not supported. To determine whether an API is available in v1.0, use the **Version** selector.

Retrieve the properties and relationships of an [organizationSettings](../resources/organizationsettings.md) object, including **profileCardProperties**.

This operation does not return [insightsSettings](../resources/insightssettings.md). Depending on the type of insights, you can get their settings by using [list itemInsights](organizationsettings-list-iteminsights.md) or [list peopleInsights](organizationsettings-list-peopleinsights.md).

This operation does not return [microsoftApplicationDataAccessSettings](../resources/microsoftApplicationDataAccessSettings.md). To get [microsoftApplicationDataAccessSettings](../resources/microsoftApplicationDataAccessSettings.md), use [list microsoftApplicationDataAccessSettings](organizationsettings-list-microsoftapplicationdataaccess.md).
