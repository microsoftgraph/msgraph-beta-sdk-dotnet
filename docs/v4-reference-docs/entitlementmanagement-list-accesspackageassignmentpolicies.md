# List accessPackageAssignmentPolicies

Namespace: microsoft.graph

> [!IMPORTANT]
> APIs under the `/beta` version in Microsoft Graph are subject to change. Use of these APIs in production applications is not supported. To determine whether an API is available in v1.0, use the **Version** selector.

In [Azure AD entitlement management](../resources/entitlementmanagement-overview.md), retrieve a list of [accessPackageAssignmentPolicy](../resources/accesspackageassignmentpolicy.md) objects. If the delegated user is in a directory role, the resulting list includes all the assignment policies that the caller has access to read, across all catalogs and access packages.  If the delegated user is an access package manager or catalog owner, they should instead retrieve the policies for the access packages they can read with [list accessPackages](entitlementmanagement-list-accesspackages.md) by including `$expand=accessPackageAssignmentPolicies` in the query.

## Permissions

One of the following permissions is required to call this API. To learn more, including how to choose permissions, see [Permissions](/graph/permissions-reference).

| Permission type                        | Permissions (from least to most privileged) |
|:---------------------------------------|:--------------------------------------------|
| Delegated (work or school account)     | EntitlementManagement.Read.All, EntitlementManagement.ReadWrite.All |
| Delegated (personal Microsoft account) | Not supported. |
| Application                            | EntitlementManagement.Read.All, EntitlementManagement.ReadWrite.All |

 [!IMPORTANT]
 Microsoft Graph SDKs use the v1.0 version of the API by default, and do not support all the types, properties, and APIs available in the beta version. For details about accessing the beta API with the SDK, see [Use the Microsoft Graph SDKs with the beta API](/graph/sdks/use-beta).

 For details about how to [add the SDK](/graph/sdks/sdk-installation) to your project and [create an authProvider](/graph/sdks/choose-authentication-providers) instance, see the [SDK documentation](/graph/sdks/sdks-overview).
