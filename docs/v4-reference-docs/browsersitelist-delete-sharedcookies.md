# Delete browserSharedCookie
Namespace: microsoft.graph

> [!IMPORTANT]
> APIs under the `/beta` version in Microsoft Graph are subject to change. Use of these APIs in production applications is not supported. To determine whether an API is available in v1.0, use the **Version** selector.

Delete a [browserSharedCookie](../resources/browsersharedcookie.md) from a [browserSiteList](../resources/browsersitelist.md).

## Permissions
One of the following permissions is required to call this API. To learn more, including how to choose permissions, see [Permissions](/graph/permissions-reference).

|Permission type|Permissions (from least to most privileged)|
|:---|:---|
|Delegated (work or school account)|BrowserSiteLists.ReadWrite.All|
|Delegated (personal Microsoft account)|Not supported.|
|Application|BrowserSiteLists.ReadWrite.All|

## HTTP request

<!-- {
  "blockType": "ignored"
}
-->
``` http
DELETE /admin/edge/internetExplorerMode/siteLists/{browserSiteListId}/sharedCookies/{browserSharedCookieId}
```

## Request headers
|Name|Description|
|:---|:---|
|Authorization|Bearer {token}. Required.|

## Request body
Do not supply a request body for this method.

## Response

If the shared cookie was not previously published, then this method returns a `204 No Content` response code on a successful delete. If the shared cookie was previously published, then this method returns a `200 OK` response code and a [browserSiteList](../resources/browsersitelist.md) object in the response body with the status as `pendingDelete`. You must publish (for example, via the [browserSiteList: publish](../api/browsersitelist-publish.md) API) the shared cookie to fully remove it from the site list.

## Examples
