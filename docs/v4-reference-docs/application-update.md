# Update application

Namespace: microsoft.graph

> [!IMPORTANT]
> APIs under the `/beta` version in Microsoft Graph are subject to change. Use of these APIs in production applications is not supported. To determine whether an API is available in v1.0, use the **Version** selector.

Update the properties of an [application](../resources/application.md) object.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Using PATCH to set [**passwordCredential**](../resources/passwordcredential.md) is not supported. Use the [addPassword](./application-addpassword.md) and [removePassword](./application-removepassword.md) methods to update the password or secret for an application.

## Permissions
One of the following permissions is required to call this API. To learn more, including how to choose permissions, see [Permissions](/graph/permissions-reference).


|Permission type      | Permissions (from least to most privileged)              |
|:--------------------|:---------------------------------------------------------|
|Delegated (work or school account) |  Application.ReadWrite.All |
|Delegated (personal Microsoft account) | Application.ReadWrite.All    |
|Application | Application.ReadWrite.OwnedBy, Application.ReadWrite.All |

## HTTP request

You can address the application using either its **id** or **appId**. **id** and **appId** are referred to as the **Object ID** and **Application (Client) ID**, respectively, in the Azure portal. Replace `{applicationObjectId}` with the **id** for the application object.

<!-- { "blockType": "ignored" } -->
```http
PATCH /applications/{applicationObjectId}
PATCH /applications(appId='{appId}')
```

To update the logo, use the PUT method as follows.
<!-- { "blockType": "ignored" } -->
```http
PUT /applications/{applicationObjectId}/logo
PUT /applications(appId='{appId}')/logo
```

## Request headers
| Name       | Description|
|:-----------|:----------|
| Authorization | Bearer {token}. Required.  |
| Content-Type | application/json. Required. |

## Request body
In the request body, supply the values for relevant fields that should be updated. Existing properties that are not included in the request body will maintain their previous values or be recalculated based on changes to other property values. For best performance, don't include existing values that haven't changed.

 [!IMPORTANT]
 Microsoft Graph SDKs use the v1.0 version of the API by default, and do not support all the types, properties, and APIs available in the beta version. For details about accessing the beta API with the SDK, see [Use the Microsoft Graph SDKs with the beta API](/graph/sdks/use-beta).

 For details about how to [add the SDK](/graph/sdks/sdk-installation) to your project and [create an authProvider](/graph/sdks/choose-authentication-providers) instance, see the [SDK documentation](/graph/sdks/sdks-overview).
