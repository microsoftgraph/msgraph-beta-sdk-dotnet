|:------------|:--------------|:-----------------------------------------------
| viewer      | string        | Optional. Preview app to use. `onedrive` or `office`. If null, a suitable viewer will be chosen automatically.
| chromeless  | boolean       | Optional. If `true` (default), the embedded view will not include any controls.
| allowEdit   | boolean       | Optional. If `true`, the file can be edited from the embedded UI.
| page        | string/number | Optional. Page number of document to start at, if applicable. Specified as string for future use cases around file types such as ZIP.
| zoom        | number        | Optional. Zoom level to start at, if applicable.

## Response

```json
{
    "getUrl": "https://www.onedrive.com/embed?foo=bar&bar=baz",
    "postParameters": "param1=value&param2=another%20value",
    "postUrl": "https://www.onedrive.com/embed_by_post"
}
```

The response will be a JSON object containing the following properties:

| Name           | Type   | Description
|:---------------|:-------|:---------------------------------------------------
| getUrl         | string | URL suitable for embedding using HTTP GET (iframes, etc.)
| postUrl        | string | URL suitable for embedding using HTTP POST (form post, JS, etc.)

Either getUrl, postUrl, or both might be returned depending on the current state of embed support for the specified options.

```

Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

param1=value&param2=another%20value
```

### Viewers

The following values are allowed for the **viewer** parameter.

| Type value | Description
|:-----------|:----------------------------------------------------------------

If `chromeless` is true, the preview will be a bare rendering of the file.
Otherwise, there may be additional toolbars/buttons displayed for interacting with the document/view.

### View/edit

If `allowEdit` is true, the document can be modified by user interaction with the embedded preview.
This capability may not be available for all preview apps or file types.

### Page/zoom

The `page` and `zoom` options might not be available for all preview apps, but will be applied if the preview app supports it.
